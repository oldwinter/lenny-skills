# Defining Product Strategy - Frameworks, Templates & Checklists

*138 artifacts extracted from Lenny's Podcast and Newsletter*

## Frameworks

### 100-Year Company Principles (Archie Abrams)
A prioritization framework used by Shopify's CEO to ensure long-term thinking over short-term revenue.

How it works: 1. Make the best product in the world. 2. Make money to do more of principle one. 3. Never reverse principles two and three.

### 10X vs 10% Thinking (Ken Norton)
A mental model for resource allocation and goal setting that encourages taking big swings for massive breakthroughs rather than settling for safe, incremental improvements.

How it works: Can be applied at the company level (e.g., Google's 70-20-10 model) or the team level (e.g., dedicating one engineer per sprint to purely innovative, high-risk ideas).

### Action Agenda (reframing strategy) (Richard Rumelt)
Rumelt's recommended reframe: don't call it a strategy, call it an action agenda. Start with ambitions, filter to addressable challenges, diagnose what makes them hard, then specify concrete actions.

How it works: Steps: 1) List all ambitions (what you want to achieve). 2) For each ambition, ask: Can I make progress on this now? What's holding me back? 3) Filter to challenges that are both important AND addressable. 4) For the chosen challenge(s), ask: What makes this hard? (Push past surface answers.) 5) Create specific action steps — things we're going to DO (not goals to achieve). 6) Ensure actions are coherent (don't fight each other). Timeline: Big company = 2-3 years. Small company = 6 months to 1 year.

### Backcasting (Christopher Lochhead)
A strategic planning method where you envision a successful future state and work backward to determine the necessary steps, rather than forecasting forward from current constraints.

How it works: Step 1: Reject the premise of the present. Step 2: Envision the future 5 years out where everything has exceeded expectations. Step 3: Write out the specifics (company size, technology, customer impact). Step 4: Looking back from that future, identify what actions were taken to make it happen.

### Beachhead / Thin Edge of the Wedge Strategy (How to kickstart and scale a consumer business—Step 2: Identify your super-specific who)
Andy Rachleff's principle that big businesses start by dominating a niche first, then expanding through references.

How it works: Principle: 'If you want to build a big business, you don't go after the big market first, because those people only buy based on references, and you don't have the references. You need to create a beachhead, a niche you can dominate. Through references, you grow from that niche of early adopters.'

Corollary (Paul Graham): 'If there were something that large numbers of people urgently needed and that could be built with the amount of effort a startup usually puts into a version one, it would probably already exist.'

Corollary (Andy Rachleff): 'If you can find a market that really wants your product—if the dogs are eating the dog food—then you can screw up almost everything in the company and you will succeed.'

### Before/After Moments (Paul Adams)
A mental model for identifying massive shifts where everything changes, requiring a reset in strategy and customer research.

How it works: Identify the launch of a paradigm-shifting tech (like ChatGPT) or a major internal change (like a pricing overhaul). Treat the 'after' as a completely new environment where past assumptions must be re-validated through customer conversations.

### Betterment over Perfection (Roger Martin)
An iterative approach to strategy that makes it less overwhelming by focusing on closing one gap at a time rather than solving everything at once

How it works: Steps: 1) Identify where your current outcomes are lower than desired outcomes (the gap). 2) Accept that current outcomes are the natural result of current choices + competitive environment. 3) Pick the single most painful gap. 4) Use the cascade to explore different choices: Could I change where I'm playing? How I'm winning? My capabilities? My management systems? 5) Make different choices to close that gap. 6) Move to the next most painful gap. 7) Repeat — gaps get smaller over time. Example: A professor who won teacher of the year repeatedly simply polled students on each session and replaced the worst-rated one every year.

### Business Model Innovation: Combine Two Models (Types of business models)
A strategy for innovating by layering a second business model on top of your primary one, with five proven combination patterns

How it works: Five combination patterns:
1. Sell a Thing + Subscription: Peloton, Mirror, iPhone + iCloud
2. Take Rate + Subscription: Shopify, Amazon Prime, DoorDash DashPass
3. Take Rate + Advertising: Instacart, Amazon
4. Advertising + Subscription: NY Times, Cable TV
5. Advertising + Sell a Thing: Kindle

Prompting questions:
- If selling a thing, could you add a subscription (Peloton, Robinhood Gold) or advertising (Kindle)?
- If take rate, could you add a subscription (Shopify, Amazon Prime) or advertising (Amazon, Instacart)?
- If usage-based, could you add a flat-fee subscription (Amazon EC2 reserved instances)?
- If advertising, could you add a take rate (affiliate program)?

### Business Model Innovation: Replace One Model with Another (Types of business models)
A strategy for disrupting your industry by swapping your existing business model for a fundamentally different one, with seven real-world case studies and six prompting questions

How it works: Seven examples:
1. Robinhood: Replaced usage-based (per-trade fees) with selling a thing (selling user data)
2. Dollar Shave Club: Replaced sell a thing (one-off razors) with subscription (monthly delivery)
3. Uber: Replaced rent/buy a thing (taxi medallions) with take rate (drivers earn without upfront cost)
4. Warby Parker: Optimized sell a thing by cutting out middlemen for cheaper, better quality glasses (DTC)
5. Rolls-Royce engines: Replaced sell a thing with rent a thing (renting engines to airlines, enabling low-cost carriers like Southwest)
6. Alibaba: Optimized sell a thing via drop-shipping from manufacturer to buyer, improving unit economics
7. Chime: Moved from usage-based (bank penalty fees) to take rate (portion of Visa transaction fees)

Prompting questions:
- If selling a thing, could you replace with take rate (Homeaway → Airbnb), usage-based (Xerox), subscription (Dollar Shave Club, SaaS vs on-prem), or rent (Rolls-Royce, Hilti)?
- If selling a thing, could you cut back one step of the value chain (Warby Parker)?
- If renting a thing, could you replace with subscription (Blockbuster → Netflix)?
- If doing take rate or usage-based, could you replace with selling a thing (TD Ameritrade → Robinhood)?
- If renting a thing, could you replace with take rate (taxi → Uber)?
- If flat-fee subscription, could you replace with usage-based (Metromile)?

### Company-Product Fit (Manik Gupta)
A mental model to evaluate if a new product idea aligns with a company's unique strengths before seeking product-market fit.

How it works: Criteria to evaluate: 1. Does this product serve the right place in the company's existing portfolio? 2. Can we play to our unique strengths? 3. Can we do it better than anyone else out there? Avoid line extensions just because competitors are doing it.

### Complementary Format Integration (Robby Stein)
Method for adding new product formats to mature products without confusing users or cannibalizing existing usage

How it works: Principles: 1) New format must be complementary not replacement (Stories didn't replace Instagram feed; AI Mode doesn't replace search). 2) Make it coherent but distinct — similar aesthetic and system integration, but different primitive with its own rules. 3) People think spatially — don't try to make existing UI elements behave differently (e.g., making a feed post ephemeral is confusing). 4) Don't assume what works in another system will work in yours — different user expectations, different use cases. 5) Continuously learn how to make the new format work for YOUR users.

### Customer Needs Pyramid (Peak Model) (Chip Conley)
Maslow's hierarchy of needs adapted for customer satisfaction and product strategy.

How it works: Base level: Meeting expectations. Middle level: Meeting desires. Top level: Meeting unrecognized needs (e.g., Airbnb moving from 'home sharing' to 'belong anywhere').

### DHM Model (Gibson Biddle)
A framework for defining product strategy by balancing customer delight with competitive advantage and business viability.

How it works: Three pillars: 1) Delight customers (aim for 10x better experience), 2) Hard to copy (e.g., brand, network effects, unique tech/personalization, economies of scale), 3) Margin enhancing (improving retention, right-sizing investments, making money).

### DHM Model (Delight, Hard-to-Copy, Margin-Enhancing) (My favorite product management templates)
Gibson Biddle's framework for defining product strategy through the lens of what delights customers, is hard to copy, and enhances margins

How it works: Product strategy framework with three filters: (1) Delight customers — does the strategy delight customers in hard-to-copy ways? (2) Hard-to-copy — what makes this advantage sustainable? (3) Margin-enhancing — does it improve the business model? Linked at: https://medium.com/@gibsonbiddle/2-the-dhm-model-6ea5dfd80792

### Definition of Strategy (Roger Martin)
Roger Martin's concise definition of what strategy is

How it works: Strategy is an integrated set of choices that compels desired customer action. Key elements: 'Integrated' — choices must reinforce each other. 'Choices' — deciding to do some things and NOT others. 'Compels' — you can't force customers but you can create conditions where they choose you. 'Desired customer action' — the ultimate test is whether customers take money out of their pocket and give it to you rather than a competitor or no one.

### Fast-Track Strategy Process (2-week version) (Strategy Blocks: An operator’s guide to product strategy)
A compressed last-resort version of the small 's' strategy process when time is extremely limited, fast-tracking through all steps rather than skipping any.

How it works: Day 1-2: Preparation
Day 3-5: Strategy Sprint
Day 6-7: Design Sprint
Day 8-9: Document Writing
Day 10: Rollout

Total: ~2 weeks. Key principle: fast-track through steps, never skip steps. Keep as last-resort approach only.

### First-Principles Strategy Framework (Eoghan McCabe)
A series of fundamental questions used to design and evaluate any new initiative, product, or event.

How it works: The framework asks: Who is this for? What is the ultimate goal? What is the mechanism by which it works? What other mechanisms can achieve that same goal? How do we define success? How does the user define value? What other things do those people find valuable?

### Foundry Process for Strategy Creation (Richard Rumelt)
Rumelt's facilitated workshop format for helping organizations create focused action agendas.

How it works: Structure: CEO + 7-8 senior leaders. Duration: 2-4 days offsite. Facilitator guides but doesn't dictate. Process: 1) Generate 25-50 problems/challenges on Post-Its or whiteboard. 2) Leaders see the full scope and realize they can't do everything — this creates natural motivation to focus. 3) Filter challenges by: Which are truly important? Which are actually addressable? Do we need outside expertise to assess addressability? 4) Select 1-2 key challenges at the intersection of important and addressable. 5) Develop coherent action steps for those challenges. 6) Output is an action agenda, NOT a traditional strategy document with mission/vision/values. Key insight: Senior executives already know 90% of what's needed — the problem is disagreement and misaligned interests, not lack of information.

### Four Strategic Choices That Determine Your Future (Seth Godin)
A framework of four interconnected strategic decisions that product people often gloss over, each of which shapes your product, company, and life.

How it works: 1. Choose your customers (smallest viable audience - their language, money, problem, technical facility, temperament) → determines everything in the product. 2. Choose your competition → defines the boundaries of your space and what game you're playing. 3. Choose your source of validation → align with your boss that you're serving the 400 target customers, not matching your boss's taste. 4. Choose your distribution → the channel fundamentally changes the product (e.g., mass retail vs. shareware vs. Steam). These four are intertwined and hard to change—make them deliberately, not by default.

### Four Types of Product Work (Fareed Mosavat)
A categorization of product initiatives to help leaders balance their portfolio and avoid over-indexing on their personal expertise.

How it works: 1. Feature work (adding value for existing users). 2. Growth work (connecting users to existing value). 3. PMF Expansion (new audience for same product, or new product for same audience). 4. Scaling work (technical and user scaling, like trust & safety).

### Hardest Problems First Prioritization (The unconventional Palantir principles that catalyzed a generation of startups)
A problem selection and prioritization philosophy that targets the biggest, hardest, most consequential problems in an industry as a competitive moat strategy.

How it works: Litmus test: If the problem you are solving doesn't show up in the news or annual report, then it's probably not a big enough challenge.

Why it works: Each 'unsolvable' problem you solve becomes intellectual property that separates you from competition and helps you establish a market of your own.

Mission-First Value Chain (correct order):
1. Mission access → establish access to the real problems
2. Product value → create value for the mission
3. Contracts → once value is proven, contracts are easy to close
4. Growth → growth follows naturally

Anti-pattern (reversed value chain): Companies try to push sales and their way of thinking onto customers → customers react like someone who wants to leave a blind date as early as possible.

What to avoid: SaaS-style upsell mechanisms, psychological tricks for customer attention, months/years obsessing over every piece of the customer funnel.

Lessons:
1. Embrace the hardest problems in your market
2. Actively say no to solving the easy ones — let someone else handle them
3. Put your customer's mission and your product vision first
4. Generate product wins, and then get paid

Example: When Congress demanded post-9/11 that the Intelligence Community find ways to share sensitive data across agencies while protecting civil liberties, Palantir built Nexus Peering — a first-of-its-kind product for multi-directional sharing without divulging sensitive sources.

### Invest Profits Not People (Vijay)
A decision framework for when to expand into adjacent products: never move engineers from the core to new ventures; instead fund new ventures with profits or venture capital

How it works: Principles: 1) If you're the leader in a core product, continue to out-invest everyone else in that core. 2) Invest profits from the core into new ventures, not people from the core. 3) Avoid accidentally entering categories where you'll be 6th-8th best. 4) Bolt-on products typically contribute only 5-10% of revenue and won't seriously accelerate growth. 5) Cutting mild successes is 10x more painful than you think. Warning signs to refocus: churn to competitors on core product + not best-in-class on any adjacent product.

### Li Jin's Five Predictions for the Passion Economy (Li Jin launches Atelier Ventures, her debut fund to invest in the passion economy)
A forward-looking framework of five trends that will shape the passion economy in the coming years, useful for product strategy and investment thesis development

How it works: 1. **Kids' fun becomes creator professions**: Activities kids do for fun today (gaming, creating content, etc.) will become the new creator professions of the future. Look to children's activities as leading indicators of where the future of work lies.
2. **Education shifts to equip creators**: Education will change dramatically to equip creators rather than training employees for traditional jobs. Gap exists in creator-focused education — programs like YouTube Creator Academy and independent creator-led courses are filling it. Opportunity for startups bridging the education gap through mentorship and content.
3. **Universal Creative Income (UCI)**: Some form of UCI will become prevalent across social platforms as the arms race to attract creators heats up. Platforms will compete on total 'comp package' for creators, including financial components.
4. **New creator financing options**: More financing options will emerge to help creators invest in their businesses, and for investors/supporters to share in upside. Crypto business models (e.g., Mirror decentralized blogging platform) align interests of creators, audiences, and platforms.
5. **New models between employment and solo creation**: Options between being an employee and being a solo creator will emerge. Examples: Forbes paid newsletters, Every — where writers get support, community, and downside protection but retain more ownership and upside. This model will spread to other creator verticals.

### Merchant-POV Theme Writing (How Shopify builds product)
A technique for writing annual strategic themes from the customer's perspective

How it works: Process: Imagine your customer (Shopify merchant) writing an email to a friend saying 'Here's why I love [Product], and here's why I'm going to keep using it for my business.' Themes should be written in the customer's voice. Example theme: 'Shopify keeps me on the cutting edge.' Themes should be deliberately amorphous to allow broad interpretation (e.g., 'cutting edge' could mean AI, developer tooling, regulations, checkout optimization). The ambiguity is intentional—it gives teams room to find the most impactful work. Number of themes: ~6 per year. Purpose: Acts as a focusing lens for teams while maintaining flexibility.

### Micro, Macro, Meta Game (Drew Houston)
A mental model derived from StarCraft for understanding business strategy at different levels of abstraction.

How it works: Micro = daily mechanics, product design, and execution. Macro = strategic resource allocation, business model, and market positioning. Meta = adapting to shifting market cycles, talent dynamics, and industry rules.

### Mission → Vision → Strategy → Goals → Roadmap (Getting better at product strategy)
The planning hierarchy that shows where strategy fits and how each element flows into the next

How it works: 1. Mission: What are we trying to achieve?
2. Vision: What does the world look like when we've achieved it?
3. Strategy: How will we achieve it?
4. Goals: How will we measure our progress towards it?
5. Roadmap: What do we need to build to get there?

Notes: Not always sequential — Goals often lead to tweaks in strategy. Both company and each initiative should have all five. Mission and Vision stay stable; Strategy, Goals, and Roadmap evolve every planning cycle.

### Mission → Vision → Strategy → Goals → Roadmap → Task (The Best of Lenny’s Newsletter—2024 Edition)
A hierarchical framework for aligning product work from high-level mission down to individual tasks

How it works: A six-level hierarchy for product organizations: 1) Mission - the company's reason for existing, 2) Vision - what the world looks like if you succeed, 3) Strategy - the approach to achieving the vision, 4) Goals - measurable outcomes that indicate progress on strategy, 5) Roadmap - the plan of work to achieve goals, 6) Task - individual units of work. Each level should flow logically from the one above it.

### Mission → Vision → Strategy → Goals → Roadmap → Task Chain (The Best of Lenny’s Newsletter 2023)
A hierarchical framework for aligning product work from high-level mission down to individual tasks. One of Lenny's most popular posts of all time.

How it works: A six-level hierarchy for product alignment: 1. Mission (why the company exists), 2. Vision (where the company is going), 3. Strategy (how to achieve the vision), 4. Goals (measurable outcomes), 5. Roadmap (what to build and when), 6. Tasks (individual work items). Each level should cascade from the one above. Referenced in the Fundamentals section of product skills.

### Mission → Vision → Strategy → Goals → Roadmap → Task hierarchy (Mission → Vision → Strategy → Goals → Roadmap → Task)
A six-layer hierarchical planning framework that connects company purpose to daily work. Each layer flows into the next: Mission (what are we trying to achieve?) → Vision (what does the world look like when we've achieved it?) → Strategy (what's our plan to win?) → Goals (how do we measure progress?) → Roadmap (what do we need to build?) → Task (what's one unit of work we can tackle next?)

How it works: Layer 1 - MISSION: What are we trying to achieve? Why does your team or company exist? What is your purpose?
Layer 2 - VISION: What does the world (or your product) look like when you've achieved your mission?
Layer 3 - STRATEGY: What's our plan for achieving it? A short description of your plan with 3-5 concrete investments that, if you get right, will bring you closer to winning.
Layer 4 - GOALS: How will we measure progress? Translate your vision into measurable metrics.
Layer 5 - ROADMAP: What do we need to build in order to get there? Prioritize based on ROI (effort vs. impact on goals).
Layer 6 - TASK: What's one unit of work we can tackle next? The atomic unit of work for your teammates.

Key insight: You need goals before you can prioritize a roadmap, because impact is measured against goals.

### Permission to Play / Right to Win (Jeetu Patel)
A mental model for deciding whether a company should enter a new market or build a new product.

How it works: Criteria: 1) Permission to play: Is it logical to the customer that your company built this? 2) Right to win: Do you have the route to market and scale advantage to achieve mass distribution?

### Playing to Win (Drew Houston)
A framework for defining where to play and how to win, especially useful when selling a commodity product.

How it works: Based on AG Lafley and Roger Martin's book. Involves being highly selective about the markets you participate in and ensuring you only enter markets where you can establish a clear leadership position.

### Playing to Win Strategy Framework (Annie Pearl)
A mental model for defining strategy as an integrated set of choices outlining how to win in a chosen marketplace.

How it works: Requires answering specific questions: What's your winning aspiration? Where are you going to play (markets, segments, personas)? How are you going to win with the target audience?

### Playing to Win vs Playing to Play (Roger Martin)
A diagnostic lens to determine if your strategy is actually creating competitive advantage or just participating in a market

How it works: Signs you're playing to play (not to win): 1) Customers could flip a coin between you and competitors. 2) A competitor lowers price and you can't match it without losing money. 3) You have no answer to 'why do customers choose us over alternatives?' Signs you're playing to win: 1) Customers actively seek you out (Lego: a toy store without Lego isn't a toy store). 2) Competitors can't bully you on price or features. 3) You're either clearly differentiated or clearly the low-cost leader. If you're neither differentiated nor low cost, 'there's no way to protect yourself' — competitors can jerk you around at will.

### Portfolio Approach to Resource Allocation (Peter Deng)
A non-binary approach to allocating resources between exploration and scaling, calibrated to company stage.

How it works: Not a binary switch between zero-to-one and scaling — it's a ramp rate. Google's 70-20-10 model may work for mature companies (70% core, 20% adjacent, 10% moonshot). For startups, might be 50/50. Key principle: Think non-binary, scale up allocation as signals emerge, every startup and product will have different ratios depending on stage.

### Product Strategy Definition and Positioning (Strategy Blocks: An operator’s guide to product strategy)
A clear definition of what product strategy is, where it sits in the organizational hierarchy, and what a good strategy articulation includes.

How it works: Position: Product strategy sits between mission/vision (durable, set by founders/CEO) and plan/roadmap (ordered list of prioritized projects). It fills the 'steep drop in elevation' between these two.

Purpose: Forces disciplined choice to deploy scarce resources for maximum impact. Resources are ALWAYS constrained relative to the universe of work that could be done.

Components of a good strategy articulation:
1. 3-5 areas of focus (strategic pillars)
2. Several areas explicitly NOT the focus
3. Clear set of explanations for why these choices were made

Two sub-parts:
- Small 's' strategy: 2-year, problem-focused, solving issues with current product
- Big 'S' strategy: 3/5/10-year, aspirational, mapping to eventual mission/vision

### Product Strategy Stack (Ravi Mehta, The Best of Lenny’s Newsletter 2023)
A five-layer framework for defining and debugging product strategy: Company Mission → Company Strategy → Product Strategy → Product Roadmap → Product Goals. Work top-down to define strategy, bottom-up to debug problems.

How it works: Five layers: 1) Company Mission (qualitative, aspirational - the change the company wants to bring to the world), 2) Company Strategy (rigorously logical plan to achieve mission), 3) Product Strategy (connective tissue between company strategy and day-to-day product work), 4) Product Roadmap (sequence of features/initiatives), 5) Product Goals (metrics to measure progress). Debug bottom-up: if goals aren't met → check roadmap → check product strategy → check company strategy → check mission.

### Raw Materials Cost Analysis (First-principles thinking)
Elon Musk's technique of breaking a product down to its raw material costs to identify whether the current price/cost structure is justified by physics or merely by convention

How it works: Process:
1. Ask: What is the product made of? (e.g. batteries: cobalt, nickel, aluminum, carbon, polymers, steel; rockets: aluminum, titanium, copper, carbon fiber)
2. Find the raw material market value (e.g. check the London Metal Exchange)
3. Calculate the theoretical floor cost if you could rearrange the atoms for free
4. Compare to current market price
5. If there's a massive gap (e.g. raw materials = $80/kWh vs. $600/kWh market price, or 2% of rocket cost), the gap represents opportunity
6. Figure out how to close the gap by rearranging the atoms more efficiently

Tesla example: Batteries were $600/kWh. Raw materials = ~$80/kWh. Conclusion: clever manufacturing could make batteries far cheaper.
SpaceX example: Raw materials = ~2% of rocket cost. Conclusion: the cost is almost entirely in inefficient assembly/manufacturing processes.

### Rumelt's Strategy Definition (Diagnosis, Guiding Policies, Actions) (Will Larson)
Richard Rumelt's three-component definition of strategy applied to engineering: a diagnosis of current reality, guiding policies to address it, and concrete actions to implement those policies.

How it works: 1) Diagnosis: What is the current status quo? What constraints are real? (Most bad strategy comes from willful disbelief about accurate diagnosis). 2) Guiding Policies: Based on diagnoses, how do you want to address them? (Good policies are often boring constraints like 'only use tools we have today'). 3) Actions: How will you implement these policies? (Rumelt is concerned about 'inert strategy' that never gets implemented). Key insight: Strategy should dictate how you invest limited capabilities into problems you care about.

### See the System (Seth Godin)
Strategic thinking defined as the ability to see and name the invisible systems (cultural, institutional, market) that constrain behavior and protect incumbents.

How it works: Systems exist wherever humans interact (handshake conventions, hiring practices, distribution norms). They serve valuable functions until they start protecting themselves at the expense of progress. Systems invent culture ('the way things are around here') and use fear to prevent change. Strategic questions: (1) Why does this scare me? (2) What system will be offended if I do this? (3) Am I working with the system or do I have enough leverage to change it? Example: 'You can't do downloadable software—it'll be pirated' was the system talking.

### Self-Cannibalization Cadence (Varun Mohan)
The product should make its current form factor look silly every 6-12 months through longer-term bets, while still maintaining incremental iteration on the existing product.

How it works: Two parallel tracks: Track 1 (Table Stakes): Incremental improvements based on user feedback, feature requests, data. Track 2 (Disruption): 3-9 month bets that are NOT informed by current user requests and aim to make the current product form factor look dumb. Goal: Every 6-12 months, the product should cannibalize its previous version. Similar to what Gara from Captions calls the 'secret roadmap.' Key tension: You can't ignore users (they're why you exist) but you also can't let user requests define your future.

### Slugging Average vs. Batting Average (Chris Hutchins)
A mental model for product bets prioritizing the magnitude of success (home runs) over the frequency of success.

How it works: Used to justify high-risk, high-reward product exploration within a larger company portfolio. It's better to hit a home run 1 out of 10 times than to get on base 3 out of 10 times with low impact.

### Small S Strategy Playbook (Chandra Janakiraman)
A 5-phase, 8-12 week process for developing a problem-focused product strategy.

How it works: Phase 1: Preparation (4 weeks). Phase 2: Strategy Sprint (1 week). Phase 3: Design Sprint (1 week). Phase 4: Document Writing (1-2 weeks). Phase 5: Rollout (2-3 weeks).

### Snowflake's Product Philosophy: Single Unified Platform (How Snowflake builds product)
Snowflake's core product philosophy that every feature must work as part of one unified platform, prioritizing performance and simplicity

How it works: Three pillars:

1. Single Platform: Snowflake is one single, unified platform. New capabilities solve integration problems for ALL customers upfront, rather than passing integration work to each customer individually.

2. Performance (non-negotiable): Products are held back from shipping until they meet high performance expectations. Continue to invest and optimize to remain the most performant in the category.

3. Simplicity: As product offerings become more complex, prioritize end-user simplicity. Maintain an 'it just works!' sentiment. Christian Kleinerman's truth: 'simplicity makes our lives harder' as PMs, but it's why customers love the product. Take extra cycles, pain, and iterations to ensure every new capability is simple.

Cultural implications:
- Zero tolerance for organizational politics
- No 'what's best for my team' — only 'what's best for Snowflake and our customers'
- Every PM treated as leader and owner regardless of title or tenure
- Even 1-2 year PMs lead discussions with senior leadership

### Software Evolution Framework (Elena Verna 4.0)
A mental model for understanding the maturity stages of new software categories.

How it works: Software progresses through three stages: 1) Capabilities (what is possible to create?), 2) Value (how do I get value out of this?), 3) Scaling (which aspects of my life/work can this integrate into?).

### Solar System Portfolio Strategy (Alex Hardimen)
A mental model for building a connected bundle of products around a core offering.

How it works: The core product (News) acts as the 'sun' providing brand heritage, trust, and the largest top-of-funnel audience. Satellite products (Games, Cooking, Audio) share the same DNA but serve different user passions, all connected via a unified bundle.

### Speed vs. Velocity Mental Model (Inspiration for the year ahead)
A framework for distinguishing between moving fast (speed) and moving fast in the right direction (velocity), used at Amazon to ensure clarity before execution.

How it works: Speed = how fast you're moving. Velocity = speed + a clear vector/direction/destination. The problem: Most people confuse speed with velocity. They go very, very fast but the destination isn't clear. The solution: Go slow first to be very clear on what you're doing and where you want to go. Then execution becomes smooth and ultimately faster. Mantra: 'Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.' Supporting variations: Karri Saarinen (Linear CEO) — 'Take some time to actually think about what you're going to do, and then do it. In the end, it's going to be faster than going back and forth and fixing things.' Ramesh Johari (Stanford) — 'Develop meaningful mental models before roadmapping. Ask: What is your model of what people care about? What makes people stay versus leave? What makes matches work versus not work?'

### Strategy Blocks Framework (Strategy Blocks: An operator’s guide to product strategy)
A comprehensive two-part framework for product and company strategy that combines a present-forward 2-year strategy (small 's') with a future-backward 3/5/10-year strategy (big 'S'), running in parallel like building a bridge from both sides of a river.

How it works: Part 1 - Small 's' Strategy (8-12 weeks, led by senior product leader): Step 1: Preparation (3-5 weeks) - assemble working group, behavioral insights, UXR insights, leadership interviews, competitive analysis, adjacent roadmaps, user observations. Step 2: Strategy Sprint (1 week) - Day 1 share-outs, Day 2 problem generation/clustering/scoring/pillar selection, Day 3 winning aspiration. Step 3: Design Sprint (1 week) - illustrative concepts. Step 4: Document Writing (1-2 weeks) - solo synthesis. Step 5: Rollout (2-3 weeks) - gatekeeper reviews, group alignment, roadshows, team empowerment.

Part 2 - Big 'S' Strategy (up to 6 months, led by senior design leader): Step 1: Preparation - small working group, mission/vision grounding, trend analysis, leader interviews. Step 2: Distinct Futures - at least 3 distinct future narratives with learning goals. Step 3: Prototypes - concept-car-style prototypes. Step 4: Convergence - UX research testing, eliminate/modify/combine. Step 5: Roadmap/Testing - push winning components into active roadmap.

The product roadmap is built through a combination of both, running in parallel.

### Strategy Choice Cascade (Five Questions) (Roger Martin)
Five integrated questions that must be answered together to form a coherent strategy: 1) What is our winning aspiration? 2) Where will we play? 3) How will we win? 4) What capabilities must we have? 5) What management systems are required?

How it works: 1. Winning Aspiration: What are we trying to accomplish? Frame in terms of customer benefit, not market opportunity. 2. Where to Play: Which customers? Which channels? Which geographies? What vertical stage in the value chain? Finished product vs component? 3. How to Win: Either differentiated (customers choose you decisively) OR low cost (can always undercut competitors). Must be backed by capabilities competitors can't/won't replicate. 4. Capabilities: What must we have that competitors don't? Look for learning curves, cumulative experience, integration into customer workflow, multifaceted systems that discourage replication. 5. Management Systems: What recruiting, training, processes, and systems maintain the capabilities? (e.g., Four Seasons' hiring/retention system that produces 10% vs 80% industry turnover)

### Strategy Working Group Composition (Strategy Blocks: An operator’s guide to product strategy)
Recommended composition of the core strategy working group for the small 's' strategy process.

How it works: Minimum core group (led by product leader):
- Product Lead (facilitates overall process)
- Engineering Lead
- Design Lead
- Data Lead

Optional additions depending on availability/resourcing:
- Product Marketing
- User Research
- Content Design

For Big 'S' strategy, different composition:
- Senior Design Leader (leads)
- 1-2 Designers
- UX Researcher

### Strategy-to-Roadmap Hierarchy (Prioritizing)
The 6-level hierarchy showing how strategy connects to daily tasks, and why you must not skip to roadmap without strategy

How it works: 1. Mission: What are we trying to achieve? 2. Vision: What does the world (or product) look like when we've achieved it? 3. Strategy: How will we achieve our vision? 4. Goals: How will we measure our progress towards it? 5. Roadmap: What do we need to build to get there? (Don't skip ahead to this step) 6. Task: What should we do today?

### Systems Thinking as Alternative to JTBD (Sriram and Aarthi)
Sriram's proposed alternative to Jobs-to-be-Done: map all players in the system, their incentives, and how they interact, then make trade-offs between competing needs

How it works: Instead of asking 'what job is the user hiring this product to do,' ask: 1) Who are ALL the players in the system? (users, power users, new users, competitors, supply chain, advertisers). 2) What are each player's incentives? 3) How do their incentives interact and conflict? 4) What trade-offs are we making between different players' experiences? Examples: Facebook PYMK (new user vs. existing user), Twitter algorithmic timeline (power user vs. casual user), Amazon hiding package data from Gmail (user convenience vs. competitive strategy).

### Tension vs. Stress in Strategy (Seth Godin)
A distinction between productive tension (the engine of innovation) and destructive stress, applied to product strategy and launches.

How it works: Stress: two opposing forces simultaneously (want to leave / need to stay). Generally bad. Tension: anticipation of possibility, 'it might not work,' the incomplete sentence that needs finishing. The engine of every art form and innovation. In product: you make a promise (X), user imagines transformed life, falls in love with possibility → tension exists until promise is kept or broken.

### The 4-Step Platform Lifecycle (Brian Balfour)
A mental model for how distribution platforms evolve from open ecosystems to closed, monetized walled gardens.

How it works: Step 0: Competitive market conditions met (consensus on category, no clear winner). Step 1: Moat identified and advantage pressed. Step 2: Platform opens to third-party developers with a value exchange (distribution for use cases). Step 3: Platform closes for control and monetization (suppressing organic reach, launching first-party apps).

### The 8 Business Models Framework (Types of business models)
A comprehensive taxonomy of all the ways a business can make money, with each model defined by how it works, examples, ideal use cases, business strategy, and the key metric to optimize

How it works: 1. Sell a Thing: Sell physical or digital products (e.g., iPhone, lemonade). Optimize: Unit economics.
2. Rent a Thing: Allow borrowing of a product you own (e.g., apartments, rental cars). Optimize: Consumption.
3. Take a Cut: Charge a % per transaction facilitated (e.g., Stripe, Airbnb, real-estate agents). Optimize: GMV.
4. Charge a Subscription: Monthly/yearly fee for access (e.g., Figma, Netflix, AT&T, gyms). Sub-types: Flat fee (Superhuman), Tiered plans (Notion), Per seat (Figma), Per host (Datadog, New Relic), Annual contracts (Oracle, gyms). Optimize: Engagement.
5. Charge Based on Usage: Fee only when product is used (e.g., Twilio, AWS, Metromile). Sub-types: One-off cost (Twilio), Per second (AWS EC2/S3), Per mile (Metromile). Optimize: Consumption.
6. Sell a Service: Provide hands-on human help (e.g., plumbers, engineers, health providers). Optimize: Skillset.
7. Advertising: Charge for access to your audience based on views/clicks/actions (e.g., Facebook, TV, billboards, podcasts). Optimize: Traffic.
8. Percentage of Assets: Charge % of assets managed or loaned (e.g., wealth advisors, loans, credit card companies). Optimize: AUM.

### The Crux (Richard Rumelt)
Borrowed from rock climbing, the crux is the hardest part of the problem. Strategy should focus on identifying and solving the crux, because if you can't handle the crux, don't attempt the climb.

How it works: From climbing: the crux is the hardest pitch or move. If you can't do the crux, don't do the climb. In business/design: 1) Identify the hardest part of your challenge. 2) Focus your analysis and creative energy on that specific difficulty. 3) Immerse yourself in the constraints until an insight emerges (as designers do). 4) The insight resolves competing needs or finds a way around the core difficulty. Examples: I.M. Pei solved the Louvre entrance crux with a transparent glass pyramid. SpaceX solved reusable rockets by landing them on their engines. Voyager solved navigation by photographing Jupiter against distant stars mid-journey.

### The Founding Hypothesis (Introducing the Foundation Sprint: From the creators of the Design Sprint)
A Mad Libs-style sentence that captures the core strategy of a product in one simple, testable statement. Used to align teams and test product-market fit assumptions.

How it works: Fill-in-the-blank sentence: 'If we help [CUSTOMER] solve [PROBLEM] with [APPROACH], they will choose it over [COMPETITORS] because our solution is [DIFFERENTIATORS].'

Examples:
- Gmail: 'If we help people with overflowing inboxes solve their email management problems with a web-based email client, they will choose it over Outlook, Hotmail, and Yahoo because our solution offers more storage and great search.'
- Blue Bottle Coffee: Helped coffee lovers solve the problem of bad coffee with a specialty coffee company, differentiating from Starbucks and local cafes with freshly roasted, carefully sourced beans.
- Flatiron Health: Helped oncologists solve the problem of fragmented cancer data with a health-tech platform, differentiating from existing EHRs.
- Slack: Helped teams with people in different locations solve internal communication problems, differentiating from email and existing chat tools.
- Google Meet (bad version): 'If we help 3D aficionados solve their virtual meeting room needs...' — absurd when made explicit.
- Google Meet (good version): 'If we help people who need to meet remotely solve the problem of complicated video calls with the fastest and easiest video call software, they will choose it over existing solutions because it runs in a browser with no setup.'

### The Kernel of Strategy (Richard Rumelt)
The three essential elements of any good strategy: (1) Diagnosis — understanding the situation and what makes the challenge hard, (2) Guiding Policy — the approach for dealing with the diagnosed challenge, and (3) Coherent Actions — specific, non-contradictory steps that implement the guiding policy.

How it works: Three elements, all required: 1) Diagnosis: What's going on? What's the nature of reality? What are we paying attention to? What hypotheses explain how things connect? 2) Guiding Policy: What are we going to do? What are we NOT doing? Must be focused (not 17 priorities). 3) Coherent Actions: Specific things we will do. Must implement the guiding policy, must not contradict each other, must be achievable. If any of the three is missing, it's not a strategy.

### The Strategy Formula (Anneka Gupta)
A two-part definition of what it means to be strategic in a product role.

How it works: 1. Come up with and articulate a compelling and simple 'why' behind decisions. 2. Champion and be a change agent for hard things that are in the long-term interest of the company.

### The Wedge Strategy Framework (Two-Part Model) (Picking a wedge)
A framework for understanding and constructing a wedge strategy, consisting of two components: the right initial product (tool) and the right initial market (place to strike)

How it works: A wedge is made up of two parts, like a physical wedge:

1. THE RIGHT TOOL (Initial Product): A very narrow, very painful problem to solve
2. THE RIGHT PLACE TO STRIKE (Initial Market): A very specific segment of people to solve that problem for

Examples:
- Tesla: Luxury car (tool) → Affluent early adopters (market) → Broader transportation market
- Robinhood: Commission-free trading (tool) → Millennials (market) → Consumer finance market
- PayPal: Online payment platform (tool) → eBay sellers (market) → Payments market
- Twilio: SMS API (tool) → Ruby on Rails developers (market) → Communication API platform
- Square: Cheap mobile credit card processor (tool) → Small independent offline retailers (market) → Broader payments/POS
- Uber: Black cars (tool) → Price-insensitive riders in SF (market) → Transportation market
- Airbnb: Renting extra rooms (tool) → Hosts with spare rooms (market) → Vacation rental market
- Amazon: Selling books (tool) → Online book buyers (market) → All e-commerce
- Carta: Cap table management (tool) → Startups (market) → Equity management platform
- Outschool: Online classes (tool) → Homeschoolers (market) → K-12 education market
- Gainsight: Customer 360 dashboard (tool) → CS teams (market) → Full customer success platform

### Three Parts of a Product Strategy (Becoming a senior Product Manager)
A framework for creating a complete product strategy, with three components that can be started in any order.

How it works: A strategy has three parts:

1. **Vision** — Sketch a storyboard of future customers using your future product, highlighting how much better their lives are vs. status quo. Model it after an infomercial — spend time explaining how painful things are today. Include strategic insights or bets so the vision feels believable.
   Example: 'Ouch! I stepped on a lego brick. It's so hard to get kids to clean up their toys. I hate being the mean mom who's always telling them to clean up. Imagine a future where cleaning up toys is a game and your kids race to be the fastest!'

2. **Strategic Framework** — Write down your target market, their pain points, and the strategic bets/differentiators you believe will win that market. Write down alternative approaches and lay out frameworks for why your approach is better.
   Example: 'With the growing trend of positive parenting, parents are looking for ways to inspire good behavior without punishments. We should enter this market with a fun game that solves one of the top pain points (putting away toys, picky eating, staying in bed at bedtime), and expand into the other pain points over time. By launching a game (instead of a tool or a book), we expand the market beyond parents to anyone who wants to buy the child a gift.'

3. **Roadmap** — Write a rough plan for the next few years' worth of work, ideally grouped into strategic themes. Then imagine someone asking 'why?' about each part — your answers form the beginning of your strategic framework.
   Example: 'This quarter: launch cleaning game. Next quarter: launch picky food game. Next half: launch 2 more games. Next year: start licensing new games to expand faster.'

### Three Pillars of Strategy (Jackie Bavaro)
A mental model for building a complete product strategy.

How it works: 1. Vision: An inspiring picture of what the future looks like. 2. Strategic Framework: The market you are going after, what success looks like, and your big bets/pillars to win. 3. Roadmap: Working backwards from the vision to check if the plan is feasible within the desired timeframe.

### Three Things to Get Right in Strategy (Getting better at product strategy)
The three sequential steps for developing a winning strategy

How it works: 1. ☝️ The actual strategy — Determining what the strategy is (problem identification, insight gathering, defining tracks of work)
2. 👏 Articulating the strategy — Making sure your team and stakeholders understand and buy into it (short, memorable, framework/metaphor)
3. 🤝 Acting on the strategy — Using the strategy for prioritization, reminding people, and evolving it over time

### Water Finds Its Own Level (Customer Tide Metaphor) (Roger Martin)
Mental model for responding to market disruption — customer preferences are like water/tides that cannot be held back, only adapted to

How it works: Principle: No matter how powerful a company is, it cannot hold back customer preferences. Examples given: 1) Microsoft maintained PC OS monopoly but share of 'minutes staring at smart screens' plummeted (0.4% smartphone OS, 4% tablets). 2) Auto OEMs hoped EVs wouldn't take off, giving Tesla a 10-year head start. 3) Walmart hoped e-commerce wouldn't take off, giving Amazon scale advantages. 4) Vanguard's Jack Bogle didn't like ETFs but had to enter the market because customers wanted them. 5) Google facing AI search disruption. Advice: Start adapting now. 'If you don't start now, it's too late.' You cannot hold back the tide even if you're one of the most powerful firms on the planet.

### When You Need a Wedge vs. Going Head-On Decision Framework (Picking a wedge)
A decision framework to determine whether your startup needs a wedge strategy or can attack the market directly

How it works: YOU NEED A WEDGE when:
- The market is ENTRENCHED (strong incumbents) — e.g., Chime vs. banks, Stripe vs. payment processors, Airbnb vs. hotels
- The market is CROWDED (many competitors) — hard to break in head-on
- The more entrenched AND competitive the market, the more valuable a wedge will be

YOU MAY NOT NEED A WEDGE when:
- You can build an amazing product that attacks a large market straight-on
- The problem requires broad coverage from day one (e.g., infrastructure management like Datadog)
- Examples of companies that succeeded without a wedge: Zoom, Slack, Workday, Notion, Datadog, Spotify, Peloton

Per Datadog CEO Olivier Pomel: 'For some classes of problems, such as infrastructure management, the wedge doesn't work. There is a large amount of stuff you need to do from day one if you want your product to be useful.'

### Wise's 10x Better Experience Framework (First-principles thinking)
Nilan Peiris's approach to building a 10x better product by breaking down the P&L into cost levers and systematically attacking each one

How it works: Step 1: Define your mission in extreme terms ('move the world's money for almost nothing, 10x better than anyone else')

Step 2: Break down your P&L into the core cost components per transaction:
- People costs (customer service, operations)
- Cost of risk (FX risk, fraud)
- Partner fees (banking infrastructure)

Step 3: For each lever, ask 'How do you step-change this? How do you do 10x better?'

Step 4: Do it the hard/unscalable way first to prove it works (e.g. sent a team to Singapore to physically verify every customer face-to-face)

Step 5: Get customers to advocate for change (Wise got customers to complain to the Singapore government about burdensome regulations)

Step 6: Win the regulatory/structural change (world's first eKYC license in Singapore)

Step 7: Scale the 10x better experience, which drives word of mouth and advocacy

Key insight: Reframe 'people costs' as 'cost of poor quality'—if products are clear and automated, you don't need as much support.

## Templates

### 2-Page Narrative Document (Ebi Atawodi)
A concise, evergreen document outlining the team's strategy and focus.

How it works: Maximum 2-4 pages containing three sections: 1. Insights (the core problems). 2. Strategy/Approach (how you will tackle them). 3. Big Rocks (the 3-5 major initiatives, prioritized like putting ice in a cocktail glass before the liquid).

### 2-Year Product Strategy Document Template (Strategy Blocks: An operator’s guide to product strategy)
A plug-and-play Google Doc template for writing the final 2-year product strategy document, incorporating user insights, competitive analysis, strategic pillars, how-might-we's, winning aspiration, and illustrative concepts.

How it works: Google Doc template linked at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iNeYUaMnpicvkpVZO-gj9cCxLeHfWN0xtGm_QoxgemE/edit?usp=sharing. The document is built from these building blocks: (1) User insights (behavioral and UXR), (2) Competitive and comparables analysis, (3) Three strategic pillars with associated how-might-we statements, (4) 2-year winning aspiration statement, (5) Illustrative design concepts for each pillar. The product lead combines, connects, and edits all pieces into a coherent document.

### Business Model Definition Template (Types of business models)
A structured template for defining any business model, based on the consistent format Lenny uses for each of the 8 models

How it works: For each business model, define:
- How it works: [One-sentence description of the value exchange]
- Examples: [3-5 real-world examples]
- Ideal for: [Type of product/service this works best for]
- Business strategy: [Step-by-step: Make/build/develop X → Monetize via Y]
- Optimize: [The single key metric to focus on, e.g., Unit economics, Consumption, GMV, Engagement, Traffic, AUM, Skillset]

### Company Strategy Template (Getting better at product strategy)
Google Doc template for writing a company-level strategy document

How it works: Link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JI73WrGplrhNE46aLyRD_B74gEynI77EPgXn1ic6WeQ/edit — Lenny's go-to starting point for company-level strategy docs, used in conjunction with the Minto Pyramid Principle structure.

### Company Strategy Template (SCR-based) (The Minto Pyramid Principle and the SCR Framework)
Lenny's favorite strategy template that maps to SCR. Mission/Vision = Situation, the gap to Vision = implied Complication, Strategy/Strategic Pillars = Resolution.

How it works: Google Doc link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JI73WrGplrhNE46aLyRD_B74gEynI77EPgXn1ic6WeQ/edit

SCR Mapping:
- Mission and Vision → Situation (where we are and where we want to be)
- Implied gap between current state and Vision → Complication (we haven't achieved our Vision yet)
- Strategy and Strategic Pillars → Resolution (how we'll get there)

### Foundation Sprint — Complete Two-Day Agenda (Introducing the Foundation Sprint: From the creators of the Design Sprint)
A detailed, timed, step-by-step agenda for running a two-day Foundation Sprint workshop to define product strategy

How it works: PREPARATION:
- Form a tiny team: max 5 people including the Decider (real decision maker)

### Minto Pyramid Principle for Strategy Docs (Getting better at product strategy)
A four-part structure for organizing any strategy document, based on the Minto Pyramid Principle

How it works: Structure:
1. What is the current situation?
2. What is the complication?
3. What is the solution?
4. How do we achieve this solution?

Instant Book Example:
1. Current situation: Guests are coming to Airbnb to book a place to stay, and hosts can accept or reject guests when they request to book their home.
2. Complication: A large percentage of guests are having a very bad time using Airbnb because they are being rejected or ignored by hosts.
3. Solution: Transition the marketplace to an 'Instant Book' model, by getting every host and guest to use Instant Book.
4. How do we achieve it: We invest in three areas: (a) Give hosts all of the essential tools they need to be successful with Instant Book, (b) Incentivize hosts to enable Instant Book, (c) Encourage guests to choose Instant Book.

### One-Page Strategic Plan (Rachel Lockett)
A single-page document that aligns the entire company from vision down to quarterly goals, inspired by Alpine Investors' People First Operating Rhythm.

How it works: Four columns: Column 1 - Vision & Values: Your north star and how people behave with each other. Column 2 - Strategic Intentions & KPIs: Core strategic bets and the metrics that matter most. Column 3 - Annual Goals: What you're committing to achieve this year. Column 4 - Quarterly Goals: Specific goals for the current quarter. Operating rhythm around the plan: - Annual kickoff: Share strategy and vision, set annual goals. - Quarterly reflection: What worked? What didn't? What's an inconvenient truth? - Regular cadence of stepping off the dance floor onto the balcony. Key question for quarterly reviews: 'What's an inconvenient truth that no one's talking about?'

### Product Strategy Document (Maggie Crowley)
A comprehensive document to align the team on the market landscape, current state, and future bets.

How it works: 1. Mission/Goals. 2. Landscape (business, products, market POV, competitors, SWOT, risks). 3. Current goals. 4. Current state (what works/doesn't, customer feedback, tech debt). 5. Opportunity (where to play/win). 6. Challenges (what must be true). 7. Solution (3 bullets). 8. Plan (sequencing, cost, team). Include an executive summary at the top.

### Product Strategy Document Template (Geoff Charles)
A structured document used by product pods to define their strategy and act as a contract with leadership.

How it works: Includes: 1) Goals (what you want to see in the world), 2) Hypothesis (why it will work), 3) Right to win (why the company is uniquely positioned), 4) Metrics (how to measure success), 5) Initiatives, 6) Risks, 7) Long-term outcomes.

### Product Strategy Prompt (YouTube Music Example) (How close is AI to replacing product managers?)
Full prompt used to generate a product strategy that beat a human PM's answer in blind testing

How it works: As a product manager for a major tech company similar to Google, Amazon, Microsoft, or Facebook, you are tasked with developing a product strategy.

Start by listing assumptions and planning out your answer in a separate bullet point section labeled "Thinking". Then follow the instructions:

## Instructions
- Define the overarching goal of the strategy or product in the first bullet point to set the context
- List each strategic initiative separately as bullet points with distinct headings conveying core action/goal
- For each initiative, provide brief explanation of current state and rationale, compare with industry benchmarks/competitors
- Outline specific benefits/outcomes expected using bullet points
- Use professional yet engaging tone with concise language
- Incorporate industry-specific terminology
- Conclude each section with how initiative impacts business
- Ensure cohesive flow reinforcing strategic narrative
- Use arrows throughout -> to show how one assumption leads to another
- Be brief and authentic
- Think deeply about what would actually work based on historical precedents. Cite examples.
- Have something resembling a real user flow with explanations behind why
- Make it tangible, not templated
- Don't label bullet points with 'Rationale', 'Expected Benefits' etc
- Don't include a summary at the end
- Keep it concise
- Make it more of an actual strategy, less of a laundry list of tactics
- Be colloquial, make minor grammatical mistakes due to being busy, maintain professionalism
- Add obscure references showing breadth of diverse ideas

[Includes detailed example for a fake streaming product 'StreamSync' with Thinking section and three strategic initiatives]

LIMIT TO THE TOP FIVE GOOD ANSWERS
DON'T USE JARGON OR CORPORATE SPEAK UNLESS IT'S SOMETHING PREVALENT IN SILICON VALLEY CULTURE
DON'T LABEL BULLET POINTS WITH A WORD THEN A COLON, JUST PROVIDE THE BULLET POINT

### Ramp Product Strategy Template (How Ramp builds product)
A Google Doc template used at Ramp for pod-level product strategy planning. Each team uses this to define their strategy bottom-up before co-developing the top-level product strategy.

How it works: The product strategy document contains these sections:
1. **Goal** → What do you want to see in the world?
2. **Hypothesis** → Why do you think this will work?
3. **Metric** → How will you measure that it does?
4. **Right to Win** → Why are we uniquely positioned to do this?
5. **Initiatives** → What do we need to do to reach the goal?
6. **Risks** → Why would we fail & what should we do about it?
7. **Long Term Outcomes** → How will this work compound?

### Three Divergent PR FAQs (Anuj Rathi)
An adaptation of Amazon's Working Backwards process where three distinct, divergent press releases are written to explore strategic options.

How it works: Write a 1-pager including launch date, value prop, customer quotes, and business owner quotes. Create 3 alternative versions (e.g., different pricing tiers or target segments) to force leadership to compare and contrast before committing.

## Checklists

### Bad Strategy Indicators (Richard Rumelt)
A checklist of signs that what you have is bad strategy (or no strategy at all).

How it works: Your strategy is bad if: 1) It's a set of performance goals or profit targets masquerading as strategy. 2) It uses fluff/word salad — fancy abstract language that sounds strategic but says nothing. 3) It's missing a diagnosis — it states the problem but not WHY the problem exists. 4) It jumps from problem statement to solution without causal understanding. 5) Actions are incoherent — they contradict each other (e.g., 'grow revenue AND increase return on equity' without explaining how). 6) It's a laundry list of everything everyone wants (e.g., 17 priorities). 7) It states what SHOULD happen rather than what you will DO (e.g., 'agencies should coordinate better'). 8) Ambitions are confused with strategy.

### Five Benefits of Using a Wedge Strategy (Picking a wedge)
Advantages a wedge gives a startup over its competition, useful for internal alignment and investor pitches

How it works: A wedge provides these advantages:

1. FASTER SALES — With a more focused value prop, your pitch and sales process become quicker and easier, driving more revenue to reinvest in growth and product
2. FASTER SOCIAL PROOF — With more customers, you can more quickly build social proof (traction, logos, testimonials)
3. CAPITAL EFFICIENCY — With early revenue, you can avoid raising a lot of money and keep ownership and control longer
4. FASTER PMF — You can build, launch, learn, and iterate toward product-market fit more quickly
5. EXPAND REVENUE — Once you've 'wedged' into a company, you can expand by offering additional products and services

### How to Get Better at Developing Strategy (Getting better at product strategy)
Five ongoing practices to improve strategic thinking abilities

How it works: 1. Spend time understanding your market (including your competition)
2. Spend time understanding your customers and their needs
3. Spend time crafting and executing strategies — and learn from those experiences
4. Study colleagues who are great strategic thinkers
5. Read about strategy

### Inflection Stress Test (Mike Maples Jr)
A set of questions to validate if a recent change truly qualifies as an inflection point.

How it works: Ask three questions: 1. What is the specific new thing introduced? 2. How does it specifically empower specific people? 3. Under what conditions might that empowerment be realized or blocked?

### LLM Prompting for Strategy Validation (Shaun Clowes)
A set of specific prompts and techniques for using ChatGPT/Claude to validate product strategy against customer feedback and competitor positioning.

How it works: Steps: 1) Put customer interview transcripts into ChatGPT, 2) Paste your strategy and ask 'Where does my strategy NOT fit what these customers talked about?', 3) Copy competitor's public positioning document and ask 'Is this a better fit for what customers said than my strategy?', 4) Ask the LLM to summarize what a competitor's strategy probably is based on their public documents, 5) Ask what competitors will probably do next. Key principle: always ask for the negative, not the positive—provoke the answers you don't want to hear.

### Leadership Interview Questions for Strategy (Strategy Blocks: An operator’s guide to product strategy)
Five structured questions to ask founders, CEO, and key leaders during strategy preparation to unearth critical strategic insights.

How it works: 1. What does success look like? What does failure look like?
2. What are some measures of success?
3. What are principles to keep in mind while building the product?
4. Why have things not worked in the past?
5. What are some of the leader's favorite/pet ideas?

### Preparation Phase Deliverables (Chandra Janakiraman)
The specific inputs required before starting a strategy sprint, assigned to members of the working group.

How it works: 1. Behavioral insights meta-analysis (Data). 2. UXR insights meta-analysis (Design/Research). 3. Leadership interviews (PM). 4. Competitive analysis stack charts (PMM/PM). 5. Adjacent roadmaps (PM). 6. User observations (Working Group).

### Qualities of Great Strategy (Getting better at product strategy)
Five criteria to evaluate whether your strategy is well-crafted

How it works: 1. Problem-oriented: Clearly identifies the problem
2. Insight-driven: Rooted in insights, both quantitative and qualitative
3. Actionable: Outlines concrete actions/investments that will solve this problem
4. Focused: Has a small number of high-leverage bets
5. Cohesive: Creates a clear path from the problem to the solution

### Qualities of Well-Articulated Strategy (Getting better at product strategy)
Five criteria to evaluate whether your strategy is communicated effectively

How it works: 1. Short
2. Memorable
3. Is explained with a framework or a metaphor
4. Leverages the rule of three
5. Is easy to find (and share)

### Radical Transparency Principles (Keith Coleman & Jay Baxter)
A set of non-negotiable principles for building trust in a user-generated moderation system.

How it works: 1. Voice of the people (no company override button). 2. Open to all of humanity (random selection, basic verification like phone number). 3. 100% open source code. 4. 100% open data (published daily for public audit).

### Six Criteria for a Good Wedge (Picking a wedge)
Evaluation criteria to assess whether your chosen wedge is strong enough to break into a market

How it works: A good wedge should meet these six criteria:

1. IS NARROW AND FOCUSED — Solves a very specific problem, for a specific group, extremely well
2. BUILDS MOMENTUM — Can be sold quickly and keeps customers coming back
3. NATURALLY EXTENDS INTO A MUCH BIGGER OPPORTUNITY — More product, more revenue, more users
4. AVOIDS COMPETITION — The whole point is to give you an easier path
5. IS HARD TO REPLICATE — It's not just about getting in, but also staying in
6. EDUCATES THE MARKET — Sometimes customers aren't ready for the bigger transformation and need to start with a small dose

### Strategy Definition Checklist (Mission → Vision → Strategy → Goals → Roadmap → Task)
Key criteria for what makes a good strategy based on the examples and guidance in the newsletter

How it works: A good strategy should:
1. Be a short description of your plan to win
2. Include 3-5 concrete investments/steps
3. Clearly identify the problem you're solving
4. Connect directly to your mission and vision
5. Be specific enough that it tells you exactly what needs to be done
6. Each investment/step should, if you get it right, bring you closer to achieving your vision

### Strategy Preparation Action Items Checklist (Strategy Blocks: An operator’s guide to product strategy)
A checklist of six discrete action items to be completed during the 3-5 week preparation phase, assigned to specific members of the strategy working group.

How it works: 1. Behavioral Insights (Data Lead): Produce comprehensive meta-analysis of past behavioral analyses. Commission net-new work to close critical gaps if identified early.
2. UXR Insights (Design Lead/User Researcher): Produce comprehensive meta-analysis of past research and user insights (qualitative and quantitative). Mobilize scrappy studies for critical gaps.
3. Leadership Interviews (Distributed across working group): Structured 1:1 sessions with founders/CEO/key leaders. Questions: (a) What does success look like? What does failure look like? (b) What are some measures of success? (c) What are principles to keep in mind while building the product? (d) Why have things not worked in the past? (e) What are some of the leader's favorite/pet ideas?
4. Competitive & Comparables Analysis (Product Lead/PMM): Head-to-head feature/strength comparison with color coding/heat map. Commentary on each player's focus and investment themes. Key feature deconstructs and screenshots.
5. Adjacent Roadmaps (applicable in large companies only): Download adjacent teams' strategies and roadmaps. Assess amplification or discouragement of certain investment areas.
6. User Observations (All working group members): Watch 1-3 user interviews or sit in on live user observation sessions. Write down takeaways to share. Purpose: build empathy, ground strategy in human-centricity.

All material consolidated into a comprehensive share-out deck. Zero effort on polish—substance over style.

### Strategy Rollout Sequence (Strategy Blocks: An operator’s guide to product strategy)
A four-step sequence for rolling out and operationalizing a completed strategy document.

How it works: Step 1: Review the strategy 1:1 with key gatekeepers (founders, CEO, etc.). Iron out adjustments from these reviews.
Step 2: Call for a group review among all key stakeholders (other functional leaders, partner team leaders). Drive toward alignment.
Step 3: Run team roadshows in groups of 8-10 team members each to encourage participation and dialogue. Check primarily for clarity of document. Adjust phrasing to improve clarity. Do NOT tinker with strategic pillars unless dramatically new signal is unearthed. Defend pillars through the established selection framework.
Step 4: Empower teams to build roadmaps with the strategy document as key input and reference. Iterate from there.

### Strategy Sprint Day-by-Day Process (Strategy Blocks: An operator’s guide to product strategy)
A day-by-day breakdown of the 3-day strategy sprint that forms the heart of the strategy process.

How it works: Day 1 - Comprehensive Share-outs: Members present their respective sections from the consolidated prep deck. Rest of the team takes notes in the form of problems affecting users or preventing product growth. Goal: achieve a shared sense of consciousness about the 'state of the union.'

Day 2 - Core Process (most important day of the entire process): (a) Generate 50-150 problem statements from Day 1 notes. Each working group member adds to shared repository (e.g. Google Sheets). Focus on volume, not quality. (b) Cluster related problems into 10-15 broader themes with short, pithy names. (c) Flip each problem cluster into an opportunity framing (e.g., 'difficulty finding features' → 'discovery'). (d) Score each opportunity on 4 dimensions: Expected Impact, Certainty of Impact, Clarity of Levers, Uniqueness of Levers. (e) Sum scores, sort by totals. Top 3 = strategic pillars. (f) Generate ~3 'how might we' statements per strategic pillar.

Day 3 - Winning Aspiration: Imagine a day 2 years in the future with significant progress on all 3 pillars. A journalist covers the work. Team generates headline versions expressing how work has made consumers' lives better and grown the company. Blend/mash multiple headlines into one statement = 2-year winning aspiration.

### Three Immediate Actions to Improve at Strategy (Getting better at product strategy)
Three things you can do right now to start getting better at strategy

How it works: 1. Find someone around you who is a great strategic thinker and ask them to help you level up
2. Ask for feedback on your existing (or past) strategies from smart people around you
3. Read at least three of the things linked to in this post

### Tips for Acting on Your Strategy (Getting better at product strategy)
Three practices to keep your strategy alive and effective after the planning cycle

How it works: 1. Remind people over and over: Don't expect anyone to remember any part of the strategy. Remind your team and stakeholders at every opportunity — every all-hands, every update email, every review meeting.
2. All prioritization should go through your strategy: One of the main goals of a strategy is to create focus — to know what NOT to do. Continue to return to it when making prioritization decisions.
3. Be ready to evolve it: Sometimes you'll be wrong, or you'll learn something new that requires adjusting your plans. Don't be sad. Learn from it, adjust it, and keep moving forward.

### Two-Step Process to Pick a Wedge (Picking a wedge)
Step-by-step process for selecting your wedge strategy

How it works: To pick a wedge, find a large market and then:

Step 1: Pick a very narrow (and very painful) problem
- Look for the most acute pain point in the market
- The problem should be painful enough that customers are already trying to solve it themselves (like the eBay seller who made her own PayPal button)
- The narrow solution should naturally lead to broader product expansion
- Example: Gainsight started with a customer 360 dashboard (simple integrations with Zendesk, Salesforce, website tag) before expanding to playbooks, marketing automation, and data science

Step 2: Pick a very specific segment to solve it for
- Target the group with the most acute pain point
- OR the highest willingness to pay
- OR the fastest sales cycles
- Look for underserved groups (e.g., Outschool → homeschoolers)
- Look for emerging groups (e.g., Twilio → new wave of Ruby on Rails developers)
- Look for specific geographies/demographics (e.g., Uber → price-insensitive riders in San Francisco)

Per Leo Polovets: 'A product that's 10x better on average might actually be 50x better for some groups but only 1.1x better for others. Picking the right group will determine whether you quickly find product-market fit or face an uphill battle.'

## Examples

### Airbnb Instant Book Strategy Case Study (Getting better at product strategy)
End-to-end example of crafting and executing a product strategy at Airbnb

How it works: Problem: Large percentage of booking requests were being rejected or ignored by hosts, creating a bad guest experience.
Vision: 'If you see it, you can book it.'
Starting metric: Only 5% of bookings were instant.
North-star goal: 100% Instant Book.
Strategy: Transition marketplace from 'Request to Book' to 'Instant Book' via three tracks:
  1. Give hosts all essential tools needed to be successful with Instant Book
  2. Incentivize hosts to enable Instant Book
  3. Encourage guests to choose Instant Book
Process: Spent weeks looking at data, talking to hosts/guests, team discussions. Developed hypotheses, ideated solutions, launched dozens of experiments. Re-evaluated quarterly.
Result: Over 80% of bookings were instant within 2.5 years.

### Cross-Applying Strategy (YouTube & Google Shopping) (Jackie Bavaro)
An example of applying a strategic framing from one product context to solve a problem in a completely different product context.

How it works: Shishir Mehrotra used the 'Consistency vs. Comprehensiveness' framing from Google Shopping to solve a YouTube strategy problem regarding whether to link out to external video sites like Hulu.

### Documentum Bowling Alley Strategy (Geoffrey Moore)
How a document management database expanded through adjacent markets.

How it works: Started in Pharma (FDA approval docs) -> expanded to Chemicals (standard operating manuals) -> expanded to Petrochemicals (oil/gas leases) -> expanded to Wall Street (financing the leases). Each segment was adjacent with similar use cases.

### Four Seasons Hotel Strategy (Roger Martin)
Complete worked example of all five cascade questions applied to Four Seasons' luxury hotel strategy

How it works: Winning Aspiration: Be the best luxury hotel for high-end business travelers. Where to Play: Hotel management only (exited real estate, construction, and ownership — owners like Bill Gates, Michael Dell own the properties). How to Win: Redefine luxury as 'service that makes up for what you left at home/office' rather than grand architecture. Customer insight: luxury travelers would rather be at home or office. Capabilities: Staff who can deliver customized, autonomous service at low levels. Key metric: 10% annual turnover vs 80% industry average, meaning average staff tenure of 10 years vs 16 months. Management Systems: Different recruiting (spending 10x more), different onboarding, different career development, better pay, better uniforms — all reinforcing low turnover. Result: By far the most successful, profitable, biggest luxury hotel chain with best employee and guest rankings.

### Gainsight's Wedge Expansion Playbook (Picking a wedge)
Detailed case study of how Gainsight used a narrow wedge product (customer 360 dashboard) and expanded into a full customer success platform

How it works: Initial Wedge: A dashboard providing a 360-degree view of each customer
- Simple integrations: Zendesk, Salesforce, and a website tag
- Collected a trove of data about each customer displayed in easy-to-understand format
- Result: Tremendous logo velocity in early days

Expansion Over Time:
- Added 'playbooks' for CSMs (customer success managers)
- Added marketing automation (automated communication with customers)
- Added data science (to predict churn)

Why the wedge worked:
1. Sold to the same buyer throughout expansion
2. Was a fast 'land' which drove lots of usage
3. Footprint extension felt very natural

Revenue expansion:
- ASPs grew from $10-15K → $30K → much higher over time
- The market wasn't initially ready for the full transformation, but the health score wedge helped early adopters recognize the power of a customer success function

### Gojek's Unifying Concept (The Driver) (Kevin Aluwi)
An example of why super apps fail without a unifying mental model, illustrated by the failure of mobile top-ups and the confusion around massage services.

How it works: To build a super app, ensure all services tie back to a single concept the user already understands (e.g., 'a driver delivering things'). If a service breaks this mental model, users won't adopt it even if it's highly relevant.

### Google Maps India Launch (Manik Gupta)
A case study on building a product despite counterintuitive market conditions.

How it works: Launched Google Maps in India when there was no addressing system and people relied on asking locals for directions. Overcame this by co-mapping the world with users and leveraging Android distribution, eventually making India the second largest market globally.

### Google vs. Yahoo Homepage (Seth Godin)
How Marissa Mayer's product decision of limiting Google's homepage to two buttons created massive word-of-mouth and stock market value, compared to Yahoo's 183 links.

How it works: Yahoo had 183 links on homepage. Google had 2 buttons. The implicit promise: 'We are smart enough to take you where you want to go without browsing 183 links.' Seth (then at Yahoo) would send confused friends to Google knowing they wouldn't come back for help. This raised his status as a tech-savvy person—the built-in social incentive to share. Yahoo could have bought Google for $10 million.

### Headspace Strategy Transformation (Strategy Blocks: An operator’s guide to product strategy)
Real example of how the Strategy Blocks framework was first applied at Headspace in 2016 to resolve team confusion and drive product reimagination.

How it works: Context: Headspace in 2016 had a product roadmap, success metrics, and mission/vision, but teams were confused about WHY they were working on chosen projects. Without clarity, teams couldn't get projects off the ground and had unproductive debates. A seasoned board member helped trace this to a lack of articulated and aligned product strategy. Result: Chandra wrote the first strategy document for Headspace, which led to the complete reimagination of Headspace, maximizing growth for guided mindfulness and adjacent spaces.

### Hypothetical Big 'S' Strategy: Future of Transportation (Strategy Blocks: An operator’s guide to product strategy)
Illustrative example of three distinct futures for a transportation company, demonstrating how to generate distinct future narratives.

How it works: Three distinct futures for a transportation company:
1. Fully Autonomous Travel: People move from point A to point B through fully automated systems.
2. Extreme-Speed Travel: Cross-world travel achieved at a fraction of current time and cost.
3. Virtual Travel: Physical travel substituted by virtual travel in many use cases due to mature AR/VR technology.
For each, outline learning goals and key questions to uncover assumptions and parameters for wide adoption and commercial viability.

### Ocean's Eleven Full Framework Example (Mission → Vision → Strategy → Goals → Roadmap → Task)
The entire Mission → Vision → Strategy → Goals → Roadmap → Task framework applied to the plot of Ocean's Eleven as a memorable teaching tool

How it works: Mission: Rob the Bellagio, Mirage, and MGM Grand casinos, and get back at rival Terry Benedict.
Vision: Great wealth (and get back with Tess).
Strategy: Get into casino cage → get through doors with code that changes every 12 hours → Get into an elevator that requires fingerprints and vocal verification → Get past two guards with Uzis → Get into the vault that all three casinos share → Steal money → Get away.
Goal: Walk out with $150,000,000.
Roadmap: Build a team of 11, do reconnaissance at the Bellagio, find all of the routes in and out, tap into the power system, hack the security systems, create a precise replica of the vault, get security codes, find transportation, practice maneuvering through security systems, execute the plan, escape.
Task: Arrive at the casino.

### P&G as Strategy Training Ground (Roger Martin)
10% of S&P 500 CEOs are ex-P&G because the company trains people deep in the organization to make strategic choices

How it works: Statistic: 10% of S&P 500 CEOs are former P&G employees. Reason: P&G believes brand managers (4+ levels below CEO) make super important strategic choices. The head and shoulders brand franchise leader reports to head of shampoos/conditioners, who reports to head of beauty care, who reports to CEO — and it's that brand manager who makes the strategic choices that determine brand success or failure. Implication: Strategy is not just a CEO activity — companies that push strategic thinking down the org chart develop better leaders.

### Pandora's Strategic Misjudgment on Radio vs. Streaming (Tom Conrad)
Pandora bet on disrupting the $30B terrestrial radio market with ad-supported radio rather than pursuing the on-demand streaming model, which allowed Spotify to walk through the digital streaming door

How it works: Pandora's thesis: terrestrial radio ($30B market, 10x more music minutes than owned music) was bigger than recorded music ($8B). They operated under a government statutory license that labels hated. Moving to direct label deals was risky but necessary for on-demand streaming. By the time Pandora pursued it, Spotify had the momentum. Additionally, Pandora lacked investor enthusiasm (ceiling comp was Musicmatch at $400M) while Spotify benefited from Netflix-era streaming optimism (comps were Pandora at $8B, Netflix at $100B).

### PostHog's all-in-one platform strategy (A year free of PostHog ($16,500 value): The all-in-one analytics, experimentation, feature flag, surveys, session replay, error tracking, data warehouse, LLM analytics platform)
Real example of a company successfully executing an all-in-one platform strategy in dev tools/product analytics, used by 300,000+ companies.

How it works: PostHog offers: analytics, experimentation, feature flags, session replay, error tracking, data warehouse, LLM analytics, surveys, and AI-powered data queries — all in one platform. Used by 300,000+ companies including 65% of every YC batch, Lovable, Supabase, ElevenLabs, and Y Combinator itself. 90% of users never exceed the free tier. Lenny notes this strategy is 'rarely done this well because it's hard to do' but if you pull it off, 'you can build a generational business.'

### Public Strategy Document Examples (Getting better at product strategy)
Four real-world examples of well-articulated strategy documents from public companies

How it works: 1. GitLab (https://about.gitlab.com/company/strategy/) — Lenny's favorite. Clear Mission, Vision, and three-part Strategy.
2. Tesla (https://archive.is/ypo0q) — Narrative style, detailed problem identification, simple four-step strategy.
3. Salesforce (https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2013/04/how-to-create-alignment-within-your-company.html) — Simple, tells you exactly what needs to be done.
4. Yahoo's 'Peanut Butter' memo (https://sriramk.com/memos/garlinghouse-peanut-butter.pdf) — Clearly identifies the problem, three-part strategy, memorable metaphor name.

### Real-Life Strategy Document Examples (Mission → Vision → Strategy → Goals → Roadmap → Task)
Four links to real strategy documents/memos from well-known companies, with annotations on what makes each effective

How it works: 1. GitLab (https://about.gitlab.com/company/strategy/): Notable for its clear mission, vision, and three-part strategy.
2. Salesforce (https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2013/04/how-to-create-alignment-within-your-company.html): Simple, but tells you exactly what needs to be done.
3. Yahoo's 'Peanut Butter' Memo (https://sriramk.com/memos/garlinghouse-peanut-butter.pdf): Notable for clearly identifying the problem and including a three-part strategy. Known as the 'Peanut Butter Manifesto.'
4. Tesla Master Plan Part Deux (https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux): Notable for its narrative style, detailed identification of problems, and very simple, ambitious yet clear four-step strategy.

### Saturn's White-Label to Consolidated App Transition (Lessons on building a viral consumer app: The story of Saturn)
Detailed case study of how Saturn transitioned from 17 separate white-labeled school apps into a single consolidated app while preserving personalization

How it works: Phase 1 - White-Label Apps (Schools 1-17):
- Each school got its own app (e.g., 'iWeston' for Weston High School)
- App icon was the school's letter
- Benefits: More recognizable on App Store, reduced download friction, looked better on users' home screens
- Experience was colorized for each school and perfectly supported schedule complexities
- Limitation: Had to ship features, bug fixes, and new school launches across 17 separate apps

Phase 2 - Consolidation (School 18+):
- Merged all apps into a single app called 'Saturn'
- Result: Significantly faster school launch rate
- Preserved personal touches: school colors, mascot, friends' avatars, school-specific schedule support
- Users still arrive, add their classes, and 'everything is reflected perfectly'
- Creates a 'how did they do that?' feeling
- Scaled to bespoke support for nearly 20,000 schools

Key decision: 'We chose to scale this personalized product approach, instead of changing the product to make it less personal.'

### Southwest Airlines Strategy (Roger Martin)
Example of a low-cost strategy with multifaceted capabilities that competitors won't replicate

How it works: Where to Play: Point-to-point routes (not hub-and-spoke), secondary airports (Providence not Logan, Midway not O'Hare). How to Win: Lowest cost position in US airlines. Capabilities/Systems that create the moat: Single aircraft type (737 only), point-to-point routing, high union wages but extreme flexibility, customer self-booking (no travel agents), secondary airports with faster turnaround. Results: #1 in US passenger seat miles, only airline to earn cost of capital over 50 years. Why competitors won't replicate: Would require selling most aircraft, tearing up hub-and-spoke, changing labor relations, firing travel agents. Competitors tried half-measures (Continental Light, Ted) that just became 'crappy Southwest.'

### Square's Wedge — Small Offline Retailers via iPhone (Picking a wedge)
How Square used a cheap mobile credit card processor to wedge into the broader payments market

How it works: Wedge product: Thanks to the iPhone, a very cheap mobile credit card processor
- Target: Food trucks, massage therapists, small independent offline retailers
- Demand signal: Tens of thousands of small businesses on waitlist before launch
- Additional appeal: One of the first POS systems using iPad — restaurants and stores thought iPad was more 'on-brand' and cool than old Micros/Aloha POS systems

Expansion: Moved upstream over time into larger retail deployments.

### Strategic Pillars Resource Allocation Example (Prioritizing)
Concrete example of how to split resources across strategic bets

How it works: Example allocation: 1. Go mobile-first: 50% of resources. 2. Expand into Japan: 30% of resources. 3. Revamp onboarding: 20% of resources. Within each, 80% goes to incremental low-risk projects and 20% to longer-term higher-risk bets.

### Strategy Blocks Applied at Meta, Headspace, and VRChat (Strategy Blocks: An operator’s guide to product strategy)
Track record of the Strategy Blocks framework across multiple high-stake contexts over 10 years.

How it works: Six different high-stake contexts across Headspace, Meta, and VRChat:
- Meta: Gained alignment on complex topics with Sheryl Sandberg, Chris Cox, and Andrew Bosworth. Led to key launches: Facebook digital well-being tools, privacy protections for youth, Quest referrals.
- VRChat: Jump-started innovation on VRChat+ subscription product with strong community response. Helped steer VRChat toward exciting long-term future.

### Strategy Examples from Tesla, Uber, and Substack (Mission → Vision → Strategy → Goals → Roadmap → Task)
Three examples of strategies structured as sequential steps, showing how companies plan to win

How it works: 1. Tesla: Build a high-priced sports car → Use that revenue to build an affordable car → Use that revenue to build an even more affordable car → While doing so, also provide zero-emission electric power
2. Uber: Launch Uber Black → Bring prices down by launching UberX → Bring prices down by launching Uber Pool → Bring prices down by launching scooters, bikes, etc.
3. Substack: Build powerful publishing tools for writers → Help writers become better writers through value-add services → Grow their audience through network effects

### Successful Horizontal Product Examples (Lessons learned from a startup that didn’t make it)
Real examples of horizontal products that won and why

How it works: 1. FIGMA: Won because it captured a much larger portion of an app designer's workflow than Sketch or Illustrator did. One specific buyer (designer) with many related tasks.

2. NOTION: Won because it addressed the vast array of documentation tasks faced by product managers in San Francisco. One specific buyer (PM) with many documentation needs.

3. AIRTABLE: Referenced as a successful horizontal play (details not elaborated).

4. WEBFLOW: Referenced as a successful horizontal play (details not elaborated).

COMMON PATTERN: All won by deeply serving one specific persona who faced a diversity of related problems.

### Tesla Full Framework Example (Mission → Vision → Strategy → Goals → Roadmap → Task)
The entire Mission → Vision → Strategy → Goals → Roadmap → Task framework applied to Tesla as a real company example

How it works: Mission: Accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.
Vision: Create the most compelling car company of the 21st century.
Strategy: Build a high-priced sports car → Use that revenue to build an affordable car → Use that revenue to build an even more affordable car → While doing so, also provide zero-emission electric power.
Goals: [Implied from vision - metrics around car sales, market share, emissions reduction]
Roadmap: [Implied - specific vehicle programs and energy products]
Task: [Implied - individual engineering and business tasks]

### Tesla Mission → Vision → Strategy → Goals example (Setting goals - Issue 23, Setting goals)
A real-world example of how Tesla's strategic hierarchy flows from mission down to measurable goals.

How it works: - **Mission**: Accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy
- **Vision**: Create the most compelling car company of the 21st century by driving the world's transition to electric vehicles
- **Strategy**:
  1. Build a sports car
  2. Use that money to build an affordable car
  3. Use that money to build an even more affordable car
  4. While doing the above, also provide zero-emission electric power generation options
- **Goals**: Elon Musk's specific production and delivery targets (referenced via Bloomberg's tracking of Elon Musk's goals — e.g., vehicle production targets, delivery milestones)

This illustrates how goals are the mechanism to know whether the strategy is being executed.

### Tesla Model S vs. Cybertruck Product Strategy (Seth Godin)
Contrasting Tesla's early Model S customer traction strategy (door handles + ludicrous mode) with the Cybertruck's divisiveness-over-utility failure.

How it works: Model S success: (1) Pop-out door handles created parking lot conversations—strangers would approach. (2) Ludicrous mode (0-60 in 2.4 sec) created a shareable experience—passengers would scream. Both created customer traction because the owner WANTED to demonstrate. Cybertruck failure: Intentionally divisive in the #1 car category (pickup trucks), targeting buyers who value utility signaling. Divisiveness is not selling—being of utility is. Missed opportunity to cross the chasm and capture Ford F-150 buyers.

### Tesla Strategy Example (Getting better at product strategy)
Tesla's mission, vision, and four-step strategy as a public example of well-articulated strategy

How it works: Company Mission: Accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy
Company Vision: Create the most compelling car company of the 21st century by driving the world's transition to electric vehicles
Company Strategy:
  (1) Build a sports car
  (2) Use that money to build an affordable car
  (3) Use that money to build an even more affordable car
  (4) While doing above, also provide zero-emission electric power generation options

### Tinder vs Hinge Strategy Stack Comparison (Ravi Mehta)
A detailed comparison of two dating apps through the Product Strategy Stack showing how similar products can have very different strategies

How it works: Mission: Tinder = 'make single life more fun' (continuous use); Hinge = 'designed to be deleted' (temporary use). Strategy: Both freemium monetization but different acquisition (Hinge = TV ads; Tinder = influencer/event marketing). Product Strategy: Tinder = lightweight swipe-based, serendipitous matching; Hinge = post-swipe, deeper profiles with prompts. Roadmap: Both invested in video chat post-pandemic; Tinder resisted filters while Hinge embraced them. Goals: Both measure meaningful conversations but through different product mechanics.

### Tinder's Anti-Filter Product Philosophy (Ravi Mehta)
Counter-example of a product decision where Tinder deliberately resisted adding search filters to preserve serendipitous matching

How it works: Most dating apps have extensive filters (occupation, income, religion, height, smoking). Tinder deliberately resisted filters. Philosophy: wanted serendipitous connections rather than search-engine-for-people experience. Result: users report meeting people they never would have met otherwise. Reflects Tinder's lightweight, fun product strategy vs competitors' more utilitarian approach.

### Tripadvisor Trip Planning Strategy (Ravi Mehta)
Example of how goals-first optimization undermined long-term product strategy at Tripadvisor

How it works: Problem: Users interleaved Tripadvisor with Google searches (search Boston hotels → TripAdvisor → search NYC hotels → TripAdvisor). Strategy: Get users to stay on TripAdvisor and plan directly within the product. Conflict: Experimental/goals-first culture optimized for immediate bookings, which pushed users through transactions quickly and AWAY from the trip planning features that would build long-term direct engagement. Result: Teams were unknowingly undermining the strategy by optimizing for short-term booking metrics.

### Twitter's Product Strategy Problem (2014) (Shreyas Doshi Live)
Case study of how Twitter post-IPO had incredible assets (product, network effects, brand, talent) but was struggling because it lacked a real, cohesive product strategy

How it works: Twitter circa 2014, right after IPO. Had strong assets: product with network effects, strong brand, talented team. Was making money but not meeting its potential. Shreyas realized after 6-9 months that the core issue was a product strategy problem — attempts were made but none produced a real compelling, cohesive product strategy. This was the moment that changed Shreyas' belief from 'execution is everything' to recognizing the critical importance of strategy.

### Zynga's Strategic Pillars (Chandra Janakiraman)
An example of highly focused, differentiated strategic pillars that drove a company to $1B in revenue.

3. Easy to sync with your Mac (most hardware companies can't make software)

What was deliberately excluded:

### Diagnostic Question: 'What makes it hard?' (Richard Rumelt)
Rumelt's go-to question when working with clients to push past surface-level problem statements to real diagnosis.

How it works: When a client states their challenge, ask: 'Why are we talking about this? What makes it hard?' Push until they reveal the real barriers. Example: Client says 'We want to open business in Australia.' Response: 'You're the CEO, just tell someone to do it. What makes it hard?' Client reveals: 'We don't know anyone there and they kicked us out last time.' Now you have a real diagnosis to work with.
