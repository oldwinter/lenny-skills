# High Stakes Decision Making - Frameworks, Templates & Checklists

*54 artifacts extracted from Lenny's Podcast and Newsletter*

## Frameworks

### Coinbase Decision-Making Framework (My favorite decision-making frameworks)
A compact Google Sheet-based decision-making framework that supports multiple deciders, decision expiration dates, and can scale from 15-minute live decisions to multi-week processes.

How it works: Key features that distinguish it from SPADE:
- Everything fits inside a single Google Sheet
- Allows multiple deciders (not just one)
- Gives the decision an expiration date
- Can be run start to finish in under 15 minutes during a meeting, or over multiple weeks for bigger decisions

When to use: 'A decision-making framework is only needed when there is lack of clarity about a decision that is higher-risk. Higher risk can mean that the decision has long-term implications or that it can be costly to unwind if the wrong decision is made.'

Best used for: Both big and small decisions that need a framework.

### Coinbase Rapids Decision-Making Framework (Shishir Mehrotra)
A decision-making ritual that assigns clear roles to participants: Responsible, Approver, Participating, Informed, and Decider (RAPID). Key innovation is pre-filling what's needed from each participant.

How it works: RAPID roles: R = Responsible, A = Approver, P = Participating, I = Informed, D = Decider. At the top of the decision document, name all people and their roles. Next to each person, put a box for their specific decision/input. The meeting runner pre-fills what they want from each person (e.g., 'Do we have the budget?' for the budget approver). Key insight: This prevents consensus-building to a fault by clarifying whose input actually matters for the decision.

### Colin Powell Decision Rule (30-70%) (Shaun Clowes)
If you're making a decision with less than 30% of available data, you're making a mistake. If you wait for 70%+, you've waited too long.

How it works: The sweet spot for PM decision-making is between 30-70% of available information. Below 30% = reckless. Above 70% = too slow. Attributed to Colin Powell. Connects to the 'data as compass not GPS' framework.

### Cynefin Framework (John Cutler)
A sense-making model to understand the type of system you are operating in to guide decision-making.

How it works: Categorizes environments into clear, complicated, complex, or chaotic systems to help leaders apply the right mental models.

### Decision Importance Framework (Brandon Chu)
A mental model for triaging product decisions to maximize a PM's time.

How it works: Criteria include: Is the decision reversible? Does it affect a lot of users in a material way? If it is highly important, spend all your time on it. If it falls into the other 98% of decisions, use your gut or delegate it immediately to keep team velocity high.

### Decision vs. Implementation Framework (Matt Mochary)
A mental model for making hard choices by separating the business decision from the human impact.

How it works: 1. Decision: What would the customer want? (e.g., only the best employees). 2. Implementation: Who gets hurt by this decision? (employee, manager, team). 3. Action: Help each hurt party get what they really want (e.g., act as an agent to find the fired employee a fulfilling job).

### Eigenquestions (Interview Q Compilation, Shishir Mehrotra)
A mental model for finding the one or two most critical questions that drive the answer to a complex problem, simplifying decision-making.

How it works: Definition: The eigenquestion is the question that when answered also answers the most subsequent questions. Method: 1) List all the questions/decisions you need to make. 2) Don't rank by importance or urgency. 3) Rank by which one would eliminate the most other questions from the list. 4) Answer that question first, then see how many others resolve automatically. YouTube example: Instead of debating 'Should we link out to ABC.com?', ask 'Will the video market value consistency or comprehensiveness?' — answering that resolved linking, embedded players, and the iPhone app decision. Coda example: 'Are we more committed to being a doc or an app?' Key insight: Practice in low-stakes/frivolous scenarios (like the teleporter question) because high-stakes environments prevent learning.

### Eigenquestions: The Art of Framing Problems (My favorite product management templates)
A framework for identifying the single most important question that, when answered, will answer all subsequent questions

How it works: A problem-framing technique where you identify the 'eigenquestion' — the one question that, if answered, makes all other questions easier or irrelevant. Helps teams focus debates on the most leveraged decisions. Linked at: https://coda.io/@shishir/eigenquestions-the-art-of-framing-problems/

### Fast-Forward to the Future (Yuhki Yamashata)
Interview and decision-making technique where you imagine the outcome of an experiment or study before running it to determine if it's worth doing

How it works: Attributed to Jeff Holden (Uber's first CPO). Process: 1) Before running an experiment or study, ask 'Let's pretend we already ran this—what do we think the results would be?' 2) If everyone agrees on the likely outcome AND that outcome wouldn't change your course of action, don't run it. 3) Used both as a PM efficiency tool and as a hiring evaluation criterion for PM candidates.

### First Principles Thinking Exercise (Geoff Charles)
A method for solving complex, unprecedented scalability or product problems without relying on Google or past pattern-matching.

How it works: Steps: 1) Shut down laptop. 2) Take out a blank piece of paper. 3) Write the core question as simply as possible at the top. 4) Spend time thinking and writing out the answer from scratch. 5) Only read/research after formulating your own thoughts.

### First-Principles Thinking 3-Step Process (First-principles thinking)
A structured approach to applying first-principles thinking to any problem, breaking it into three main steps with detailed sub-techniques

How it works: Step 1: Describe what you want your team or company to achieve (e.g. 'Build a 10x better way to buy books')

Step 2: Identify each lever/component that is keeping you from achieving this goal/vision (e.g. lowest prices, fastest delivery, highest selection)

Step 3: Systematically question every assumption that you and your colleagues have about what is keeping you from moving these levers, using three sub-techniques:

3a. Ask fertile questions:
  1. Confirming questions: 'Are we sure that's true?'
  2. What-if questions: 'What if this were possible?'
  3. Possibility questions: 'What would need to be true for this to be possible?'
  4. Confidence questions: 'How confident are you in that conclusion?'
  5. Evidence questions: 'What evidence do you have for that conclusion?'
  6. Why questions: 'Why is that?' (repeat multiple times)
  7. Dumb questions: 'Can you explain this to me?'
  8. Clarifying questions: 'Can you clarify what you mean by that?'
  9. Example questions: 'Can you give me an example of that?'
  10. Certainty questions: 'What do we know to be absolutely true?'

3b. Go to the source:
  - Visit the factory
  - Read the primary research
  - Talk to the people making the raw ingredients (or APIs)
  - Push back on gatekeepers
  - Question 'authority'—remember authority bias

3c. Try it before you conclude it's not possible:
  - Run a quick experiment
  - Crunch your own numbers
  - Put together a skunkworks team to give it a shot

With each question, keep asking 'why' until you hit the floor.

### Framework Selection Guide (Structured to Least Structured) (My favorite decision-making frameworks)
Lenny's ranking of decision-making frameworks from most structured to least structured, with guidance on when to use each.

How it works: Ranked from most structured to least:
1. S.P.A.D.E. — Best for: Major company or strategy-level decisions
2. Coinbase Framework — Best for: Both big and small decisions that need a framework (can run in 15 min or over weeks)
3. Dory and Pulse — Best for: Real-time decisions during meetings (14 variations for different contexts)
4. RAPID — Best for: When you mainly need to clarify people's roles in the decision-making process
5. Eisenhower Matrix — Best for: Prioritizing tasks/projects/investments

### Information Decay Rate (Shaun Clowes)
The concept that all information—customer feedback, competitor intelligence, market data—has a decay rate and loses value to decision-making very quickly.

How it works: Key implications: 1) LLMs can only be as good as the data they're given and how recent it is, 2) You can plot your own decay chart for different information types, 3) This is why data management (timeliness, quality, structure) matters more than model selection for AI products, 4) LLMs are 'limitless information eaters'—you can never give them enough, the more you give the better they get.

### Knowing What I Know Today Test (Uri Levine)
A universal decision-making framework: periodically ask 'knowing what I know today, would I do something different?' and if yes, make the change now.

How it works: Application areas: Hiring (30-day check), career path (90-day check for his children), relationships, purchases, strategic direction. Key principle: If you don't set a timeline to revisit the decision, you'll never revisit it. For hiring: 30 days. For career/job satisfaction: 90 days. For everything: 'Today is the first day of the rest of your life.'

### Kombucha Scale (My favorite decision-making frameworks)
A quick mental model from Square for determining whether a decision warrants a formal framework, based on two variables: importance and urgency.

How it works: Two variables: Importance and Urgency.

If the choice is as simple as selecting a flavor of kombucha, everyone can save the time and effort spent on a thorough decision-making process. Decision-making frameworks are meant for hard decisions — things that would have real consequences for a company or group. Use this as a quick gut-check before launching into a formal process.

### Mental Time Travel (Annie Duke)
A decision-making tool to gain perspective by imagining how you will view a current situation years in the future.

How it works: Ask yourself: 'How will I think about this in 10 years? Will I still be heartbroken/upset?' Use this to right-size the emotional weight of a current problem.

### Negative Visualization (Jason Fried)
A Stoic practice used to manage risk and anxiety when launching new initiatives.

How it works: Role-play the worst-case scenario of a decision or project. Find peace with that outcome before moving forward, ensuring the business can survive the failure.

### One-Way vs. Two-Way Door Decisions (Nickey Skarstad)
A mental model to determine how much debate and alignment a decision requires.

How it works: One-way doors (e.g., defining platform-wide quality standards or policies) are hard to reverse and require deep debate, leadership buy-in, and slow deliberation. Two-way doors are easily reversible; give teams autonomy to move fast and skip heavy review processes.

### One-way vs. Two-way Doors (Mihika Kapoor)
Jeff Bezos's mental model for decision making, used to maintain momentum by recognizing most software decisions are reversible.

How it works: Use this to lower the stakes of decisions and encourage putting an opinion out there to get reactions, knowing you can revert if needed.

### Pre-mortem with Tigers, Paper Tigers, and Elephants (Shreyas Doshi)
A structured pre-mortem meeting framework where you imagine the project has failed, then categorize risks into three types: Tigers (real threats that will kill the project), Paper Tigers (perceived threats that aren't actually concerning), and Elephants (important issues no one is talking about)

How it works: Steps: 1) Open with prompt: 'Imagine this project has failed 6 months from now. What went wrong?' 2) Give 5-10 minutes of silent time for each team member to write their tigers, paper tigers, and elephants in a shared doc (hidden from others). 3) Go around the room and share. 4) Each person votes on the scariest tiger that someone ELSE mentioned. 5) Leader prioritizes the output and creates a pre-mortem action plan. 6) Leader stays accountable for progress. For large launches, run separate pre-mortems for engineering and go-to-market.

### Quantified vs. Data-Driven Decision Making (Ramesh Johari)
Approach that combines experiment results with leadership team beliefs to make decisions when data alone is insufficient, especially for long-term or hard-to-measure effects

How it works: When you can't measure everything: (1) Gather competing beliefs from leadership about unmeasurable factors (e.g., retention value of Superhost). (2) Combine these beliefs with experiment results. (3) Ask: 'Given what we believe AND what the data says, is this enough to make the bet?' Works like a prediction market for business assumptions. Contrasts with purely data-driven approaches that ignore things that can't be measured.

### RAPID Decision-Making (DRI Model) (Sanchan Saxena)
Coinbase's decision-making framework where a Directly Responsible Individual collects written input from stakeholders and makes the final call, with others committing to 'disagree and champion.'

How it works: Structure: 1) Establish a DRI for every project (can be from any function: ops, engineering, design, legal, marketing), 2) All cross-functional input is provided in writing (written culture like Amazon), 3) DRI reads all input and makes the decision — not the least common denominator that annoys everyone least, 4) Others 'disagree and champion' — publicly support the decision as if it were their own, 5) Same format used from exec-level decisions down to individual team decisions. Key difference from consensus: 'Speed of decision-making is proportional to the DRI's authority, not the strength of your relationships.'

### RAPID Decision-Making Framework (Hari Srinivasan, My favorite decision-making frameworks)
A model to clarify roles in complex decisions to ensure speed and accountability.

How it works: R = Recommend: The person who proposes a course of action
A = Agree: The person(s) who must agree/sign off (have veto power)
P = Perform: The person(s) who will execute the decision
I = Input: The person(s) who provide information and facts to inform the decision
D = Decide: The person who has final decision-making authority

Key guidance: 'Start by applying RAPID to high-value or high-frequency decisions. They create positive and visible impact on priority decisions while enhancing decision-making skills across the organization. Over time, the RAPID framework becomes intuitive.'

Best used for: When you mostly need to clarify people's roles in the decision-making process vs. needing a full plug-and-play process.

### RIDE Decision-Making Framework (Heidi Helfand)
A model for clarifying roles in decision-making during periods of change.

How it works: R = Request (who is requesting the change), I = Input (who can give input), D = Decider (who makes the final decision), E = Execute (who rolls out the change).

### Reversible vs. Irreversible Decisions (Gibson Biddle)
A mental model for evaluating the risk of a decision based on its magnitude and reversibility.

How it works: Assess decisions by asking: Is it high stakes or low stakes? Is it reversible? If reversible (a two-way door), you can move fast and test it, even if it has a high temporary cost (e.g., Netflix auto-canceling inactive users costing $100M).

### S.P.A.D.E. Decision-Making Framework (My favorite decision-making frameworks, My favorite product management templates)
A structured decision-making framework that replaces consensus with accountability by assigning a single responsible decision-maker. SPADE stands for Setting, People, Alternatives, Decide, Explain.

How it works: S = Setting: Define the problem clearly, identify what decision needs to be made, and set a timeline.
P = People: Identify who is responsible (the decision-maker), who needs to be consulted, and who needs to approve.
A = Alternatives: Lay out all possible alternatives/options exhaustively.
D = Decide: The responsible person makes the decision (not consensus). The person executing the decision is the one who decides.
E = Explain: Communicate the decision clearly and rally everyone around it.

Key principle: 'What is important isn't that everyone agrees, it's that everyone is listened to. And then the right person makes a decision, communicates it clearly, and rallies everyone around it.'

Best used for: Major company or strategy-level decisions.

### Scenario Planning for Crisis (Three Scenarios) (Leading your company through a pandemic - Issue 20)
Framework for modeling business outcomes under three severity levels during an economic crisis

How it works: Step 1: Build and understand a worst-case scenario. Ask: What would happen if you had to sustain 6 months of zero revenue, and 18 more months without the ability to profitably acquire new customers?

Step 2: Understand the true upside case. Consider: legacy competitors may be hit harder, consumer behavior is shifting rapidly, and customer acquisition channels are less competitive (CPMs down ~50%).

Step 3: Sketch out at least three scenarios:
- A modest downturn
- A more severe recession
- A full-blown depression (defined by both duration and severity)

For each scenario, determine:
- How would reduced consumer borrowing capacity reduce demand?
- Will job insecurity make creditworthy customers reluctant to spend?
- Will reduced demand affect your ability to secure financing?
- Will higher borrowing costs raise your cost of capital?

Step 4: Before you know which scenario you're in, preserve optionality by:
- Cutting spend to extend runway
- Keeping as much of the team as possible
- Maintaining trust with customers (no knee-jerk pricing/policy changes)

### Sequoia COVID-19 Scenario Matrix (Leading your company through a pandemic - Issue 20)
A 2x2 matrix for thinking through business scenarios based on severity and duration of crisis

How it works: A matrix with two axes:
- X-axis: Duration (shorter vs. longer)
- Y-axis: Severity (less severe vs. more severe)

This creates four quadrants for planning different business responses depending on how long and how severe the crisis turns out to be. Use it to map your plans for each combination.

### Single Decisive Reason (SDR) (Rahul Vohra)
A decision-making tool learned from Reid Hoffman where you must identify one reason that alone justifies a decision, preventing collections of weak reasons from driving choices

How it works: Process: 1) When someone proposes a decision with multiple reasons, ask 'What's the SDR?' 2) For each reason, test: 'If this were true and all other reasons were not true, would you still make this decision?' 3) If no single reason passes that test, the decision hasn't been properly justified yet. 4) A collection of weak reasons rarely adds up to a strong reason and often hides a strong reason on the other side.

### Six-Month Memory Test for Decision-Making (Will Larson)
A simple heuristic for reducing decision stress: ask 'will anyone remember what we decided in six months?' and if not, make a reasonable choice and move on.

How it works: Question: 'Will anyone care in six months what we decided here?' If no → do something reasonable and move on to the next more important thing. Rationale: Most decisions people stress about aren't that important. Reduces decision fatigue and frees energy for truly consequential decisions.

### Tab vs. Separate App Decision Framework (The inside story of Facebook Marketplace)
How Facebook decided between adding a tab in the main app vs. launching a separate marketplace app

How it works: Arguments for Tab in existing app: (1) Leverages the existing ecosystem where millions are already trading in communities. (2) Users already have the app installed and open it frequently. (3) Enables serendipitous discovery — users can see new listings while already using the app. (4) Integrates naturally with existing features like Messenger, Groups, and identity/trust. Arguments for Separate app: (1) More design flexibility. (2) Dedicated experience. (3) Independent metrics. Facebook's decision: Tab in the main app. Outcome: Expected to eventually launch a separate app once successful, but this never happened because the integrated experience proved to be the better product.

### The Historian Approach to Decision Making (Anneka Gupta)
A method for new leaders to understand organizational baggage and improve decision-making.

How it works: When joining a company or starting a project, investigate past initiatives: What products failed? Why did they fail? What was the historical context for past decisions? What baggage do people have about trying this again?

### Thinking Gray (Austin Hay)
A leadership and decision-making principle from Steven B. Sample's 'The Contrarian's Guide to Leadership'.

How it works: The practice of intentionally delaying a decision (not thinking in black or white) for as long as possible until a decision absolutely must be made, allowing more time to gather information and avoid premature judgments.

### Trapdoor Decisions (Eeke de Milliano)
A mental model for decision speed, identifying if a decision can be easily reversed.

How it works: Pricing is often a two-way door (can grandfather users), while giving out job titles is a one-way door (trapdoor) that requires rigorous thought.

### Two-Way Door Misapplication Pattern (Shreyas Doshi Live)
A critique of how Bezos' two-way door / one-way door framework is commonly misapplied by PM leaders, where most decisions that appear reversible are actually irreversible at the PM level

How it works: The pattern: 1) Team decides a feature request is a 'two-way door' and commits quickly without thinking through customer motivation, differentiation, or distribution; 2) Feature ships with low adoption; 3) At QBR, PM uses favorable anecdotes instead of data to present results; 4) Sales says feature isn't winning deals because it's 'not full featured'; 5) Someone says 'meet the table stakes' and now you're committed to even more work; 6) You've signed up for more work on a feature you shouldn't have built. Key insight: These are two-way doors at Bezos' level but one-way doors for PMs. Solution: Pause for two minutes, two days, or two weeks before committing.

### Type-1 and Type-2 Decisions (How to get into product management, Startup PM vs. big company PM)
Jeff Bezos's framework for categorizing decisions as irreversible (Type-1) or reversible (Type-2) to determine how much deliberation is warranted

How it works: **Type-1 Decisions**: Irreversible, high-consequence decisions — like walking through a one-way door. These deserve careful deliberation, consultation, and analysis.
**Type-2 Decisions**: Reversible, lower-consequence decisions — like walking through a two-way door. These should be made quickly by individuals or small groups. Most decisions are Type-2.

The mistake large organizations make is using heavy-weight Type-1 decision-making processes for Type-2 decisions, which slows everything down.

### User Value Litmus Test for Technology Bets (Sam Schillace)
Before committing to a technology trend, ask: 'Even in the best case, if this fully works, does it create clear value for an end user that makes their life meaningfully easier?' If you can't articulate that, don't bet on it.

How it works: Test: 'What if this works perfectly? As a user, what problem does it solve for me?' If the answer is compelling (Tesla: 'A car that works like a car but is way cheaper to operate'), proceed. If the answer is unclear or dystopian (Crypto: 'I have to run my own SEC on my personal finances'), walk away. Key principle: No one adopts anything for any reason other than it makes their life better. No amount of marketing can overcome lack of user value.

### When to Think from First Principles (How Ramp builds product)
A decision framework for knowing when to invest time in deep first-principles thinking vs. moving fast

How it works: You can't think deeply about everything — you don't have enough time. Invest in first-principles thinking when:

1. A critical user EXPERIENCE is dependent on it. Example: Ramp's payments PM understands what each line of an ACH payment file represents. Head of design visited factory floors to choose the right premium metal card.

2. A high-cost business DECISION is dependent on it. Example: Instead of taking legal counsel's advice at face value, read the statutes yourself. How does the state of Texas define money transmission?

3. An important business PROCESS needs to be defined for scale. Example: Hiring guides at Ramp are long and exhaustive, listing highly specific behaviors and attitudes to evaluate candidates.

## Templates

### Mediating Judgments Rubric (Annie Duke)
A structured evaluation tool used to score investments or projects on a 1-7 scale across shared definitions.

How it works: Break down implicit intuition into explicit categories (market, team, founder, product). Define shared meanings for each. Score independently on a 1-7 scale. Forecast specific intermediate milestones (e.g., probability of Series A funding).

### Pre-mortem Coda Template (Shreyas Doshi)
A Coda document template for running pre-mortems using the tigers/paper tigers/elephants method

How it works: Available as a Coda doc (mentioned as something to link in show notes). Includes the full pre-mortem process template with sections for tigers, paper tigers, elephants, voting, and action plans.

### Pre-mortem with Kill Criteria (Annie Duke)
A framework for identifying potential failure points and pre-committing to actions if those signals appear.

How it works: 1. Identify early signals of failure. 2. Establish a 'kill criteria' for each signal. 3. Pre-commit to a specific action (e.g., kill the project, pivot) if the signal is observed.

## Checklists

### Brian Armstrong's Attributes of Good Decision-Making (My favorite decision-making frameworks)
A set of attributes to evaluate and aim for when designing your decision-making process.

How it works: Referenced as an image in the newsletter — a set of desirable attributes for evaluating your decision-making process quality. Used as evaluation criteria when choosing or customizing a decision-making framework. (Specific attributes are in the referenced image.)

### Decision-Making Frameworks Resource List (Autonomy vs. direction - Issue 35)

- Jeff Bezos on two-way-door decisions (Inc.com)

### Mental Models for Better Decision-Making (My favorite decision-making frameworks)
A curated list of mental models split into two categories: seeing the problem clearly and seeing opportunities clearly.

How it works: See the problem more clearly:
1. Eigenquestions by Shishir Mehrotra — the art of framing problems (https://coda.io/@shishir/eigenquestions-the-art-of-framing-problems)
2. One-way-door vs. two-way-door decisions (Type 1 vs Type 2) by Jeff Bezos (https://fs.blog/reversible-irreversible-decisions/)
3. Cynefin Framework by Dave Snowden (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7oz366X0-8)
4. A Leader's Guide to Deciding: What, When, and How to Decide by Steven Sinofsky (https://medium.learningbyshipping.com/a-leader-s-guide-to-deciding-what-when-and-how-to-decide-f6caf659fa7e)

See the opportunities more clearly:
1. SWOT analysis (https://asana.com/resources/swot-analysis)
2. McKinsey's 7S Model (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mckinsey-7s-model.asp)
3. Thinking in Bets by Annie Duke
4. The 10-10-10 decision-making technique by Suzy Welch
5. The Regret Minimization Framework by Jeff Bezos

### Post-Decision Action Checklist (My favorite decision-making frameworks)
Four steps to take after making a decision to ensure follow-through and alignment.

How it works: Once you've made a decision:
1. Celebrate 🎉
2. Communicate your plan using the Minto Pyramid Principle and the SCR Framework (https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/minto-pyramid-principle-scr)
3. Learn to get better at getting buy-in (https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/getting-buy-in)
4. Build your influence muscle (https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/how-to-get-better-at-influence)

### Three Caveats Before Using Decision-Making Frameworks (My favorite decision-making frameworks)
Three things to consider before applying any decision-making framework.

How it works: 1. Prioritize trust: If your team is asking you to use a framework on many decisions, it could be a sign they don't trust your judgment. Get things done through influence and trust first. (Exception: as company scales and stakeholders grow, structured process helps ensure everyone's voice is heard.)
2. Save frameworks for big (one-way-door) decisions: Use the 'kombucha scale' — if the choice is trivial, skip the framework. Reserve it for decisions with real consequences.
3. Make these frameworks your own: Don't assume the framework as written is the only way it can work. Tweak it for your company and context.

## Examples

### Coinbase's Decision-Making Process (My favorite product management templates)
Brian Armstrong's description of how Coinbase makes decisions, serving as a real-world example of structured decision-making at a major company

How it works: Describes Coinbase's approach to making decisions including how they handle disagreements, who has decision rights, and how they communicate decisions. Linked at: https://medium.com/@barmstrong/how-we-make-decisions-at-coinbase-cd6c630322e9

### LoudCloud IPO Decision (Ben Horowitz)
A case study in choosing between two terrible options.

How it works: Going public with $2M trailing revenue at 18 months old was a bad idea that guaranteed negative press (dubbed 'The IPO from Hell'), but the alternative was bankruptcy. Illustrates the necessity of running towards fear and making the slightly better, yet painful, choice.

### One-Way-Door Decision Concept (from Amazon) (My favorite PM interview questions)
The concept of 'one-way-door' decisions — irreversible decisions that require careful deliberation — used as the basis for the bonus decision-making interview question.

How it works: One-way-door decisions are irreversible or nearly irreversible decisions (as opposed to two-way-door decisions that can be easily reversed). Lenny uses this as the frame for his bonus PM interview question: 'What's the biggest one-way-door product decision you've ever had to make?' This tests whether the candidate can distinguish between decision types, apply appropriate rigor to high-stakes decisions, de-risk them, and bring stakeholders along.

### YouTube's Modern Family / Consistency vs. Comprehensiveness Decision (Shishir Mehrotra)
YouTube's pivotal strategic decision where reframing from 'should we link out to ABC.com' to 'does this market value consistency or comprehensiveness' resolved multiple major decisions including taking back the YouTube iPhone app from Apple.

How it works: Context (2008): YouTube seen as Google's first bad acquisition. Modern Family was top search query but not on YouTube. Company split: product team wanted to link to ABC.com (user-first), business team opposed (content partners would never upload).
