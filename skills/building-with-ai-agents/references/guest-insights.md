## Guillermo Rauch

> "But there's a little bit of a writer's block sometimes. So one of my favorite things that I've seen, and I'm even looking at the home page right now, and you can see a random assortment of community submissions. And they have 1,200 forks, and 1,500 forks, and 6,000 forks, and this is every time people saying like, 'Oh, instead of starting from scratch, I'll start from this application that someone else has built and I'm going to prompt it to modify it and make it my own.'"

**Insight:** To overcome creative or technical blocks, leverage the 'social coding' evolution by forking and modifying existing community prototypes rather than starting from zero.

**Tactical advice:**
- Browse community galleries for starting points like menus, logos, or app layouts.
- Fork existing prototypes and prompt the AI to modify them to fit your specific use case.
- Invert the workflow by starting with high-level intent prompts to generate the first version of code automatically.

## Lazar Jovanovic

> "AI just don't understand what do you mean when you say, 'You know what I mean?' So you need to be specific. I'm optimizing 100% of my time today on good judgment, clarity, quality, taste."

**Insight:** Effective communication with AI requires abandoning the assumption that the tool understands your implicit intent and instead providing absolute specificity.

**Tactical advice:**
- Avoid vague phrases like 'you know what I mean' when prompting an AI agent.
- Treat AI tools as technical co-founders that require clear, granular instructions to succeed.
- Optimize for clarity in the 'ask' rather than focusing on the speed of the code generation.

> "In order for you to steer the ship, you have to know the instructions, right? And the best way to learn is by building, but treating these tools almost as technical co-founders and educators, and learning while doing, and religiously reading the agent output."

**Insight:** When troubleshooting AI-generated software, prioritize understanding the agent's logic and natural language output over the underlying code syntax.

**Tactical advice:**
- Religiously read the agent's natural language explanations to understand the logic of the generated code.
- Trust the AI's ability to handle syntax while you focus on steering the high-level intent.
- Use chat mode to treat the AI as an educator when you encounter technical blocks or errors.

---

> "Ask yourself: What ongoing work requires some judgment and writing abilities—but not your full expertise and intuition? Put another way, if my company assigned me a junior intern, what would I have them do?"

**Insight:** Identify tasks for AI delegation by using the 'junior intern' mental model to find work that requires basic judgment but doesn't need your high-level intuition.

**Tactical advice:**
- Select ongoing tasks that arrive continually rather than one-time batch exports.
- Focus on energy-draining work like syncing sources of truth or acting as meeting mission control.
- Phrase the automation goal in one or two sentences as if you were messaging an intern in Slack.

---

> "Just as when delegating to people, the fanciest AI will perform only as well as the instructions it’s given. Are you clear on how you would accomplish this task manually, with mouse, keyboard, and coffee?"

**Insight:** A successful AI agent design requires a deep understanding of the manual workflow and a focus on limiting scope to the most tedious sub-tasks.

**Tactical advice:**
- Manually complete the task a few times first to identify exactly where the key information lives.
- Provide specific examples of what a successful outcome looks like to improve agent performance.
- Start by delegating only the single most dreaded part of a larger workflow to ensure early success.

---

> "Just as when delegating to people, the fanciest AI will perform only as well as the instructions it’s given. The best way to gain this clarity is to do the task once or twice."

**Insight:** Treat agent prompting like delegating to a human by providing clear instructions and specific templates of your past work to guide the AI's output.

**Tactical advice:**
- Draft your automation instructions as a natural language prompt describing your manual mouse and keyboard steps.
- Insert specific templates or examples of past updates into the agent's context to maintain consistency.
- Use brackets to indicate where the agent should trigger specific tools like calendar searches or messaging actions.

> "Claire Vo told me that Devin is the #2 contributor to her six-figure ChatPRD business (behind only her, for now) and touches 100% of their PRs, by reviewing code, updating documentation, or writing all of the code."

**Insight:** Solo founders can achieve significant business scale by utilizing autonomous AI as their primary engineering contributor to handle the bulk of development and maintenance.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use AI to handle lower-level technical work so you can spend your limited time figuring out what to build and how to grow.
- Integrate the AI agent into every pull request to automate code reviews and keep documentation current.
- Leverage autonomous agents to manage high-effort tasks like data analysis or complex migrations that usually require a larger headcount.

---

**Insight:** Structuring AI interactions as multi-step workflows—first analyzing requirements and then executing—provides significantly more control over complex outputs.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use an initial prompt to analyze and bullet-point the components of a successful style.
- Feed the analyzed components back into a second prompt as a specific style guide.
- Utilize 'synthetic bootstrap' to generate multiple AI examples for in-context learning when real-world data is limited.

> "Of all the flavors and approaches of agents today, the category I refer to as “AI automations” is currently the most practical for helping product managers with monotonous busywork. This includes tools like Zapier, Lindy AI, Relay App, Gumloop, Cassidy AI, and so on."

**Insight:** Select an 'AI automation' platform based on its ability to integrate with your existing tool stack and its focus on practical, browser-based PM tasks.

**Tactical advice:**
- Evaluate platforms by checking which 'agentic' behaviors they support, such as acting proactively versus waiting for prompts.
- Prioritize tools like Zapier or Gumloop if you need deep integration with standard apps like Slack, Jira, and Google Calendar.
- Assess a tool's suitability by determining if it primarily leverages live data or static knowledge bases.

---

> "It’s more realistic to approach our agent like a new product, or a new process. As PMs, we know that to make both successful, we need to start small and cut scope."

**Insight:** Treat your AI agent as a product by launching a Minimum Viable Agent with limited scope and iterating based on its real-world output.

**Tactical advice:**
- Start with a single use case, like monitoring one competitor instead of five, to keep the initial build manageable.
- Review the agent's work against your manual examples to identify where the prompt instructions need refinement.
- Gradually increase the agent's responsibilities only after it consistently succeeds at its primary task.

> "Constraining the agent to only DM frees us for worry-free experimentation. Turn it on. (Don’t sweat this decision, since the only action it can take is privately DMing you.)"

**Insight:** Mitigate security and deployment risks by initially limiting an AI agent’s output to private direct messages where errors can be reviewed safely.

**Tactical advice:**
- Restrict the agent's permissions to private channels during the testing phase to prevent public data leaks.
- Evaluate platform security by examining how the tool handles internal knowledge bases and company context.
- Ensure the agent only has 'read' access to sensitive data until it has proven its reliability in private environments.

---

**Insight:** The operationalization of AI agents requires balancing long-term productivity gains against the complexities of setup costs and the steep learning curve.

**Tactical advice:**
- Acknowledge and plan for the high learning curve associated with operationalizing AI agents for product work.
- Prioritize high-impact, repetitive tasks to ensure the time spent on setup provides a significant return on investment.
- Monitor the performance of your first agent closely to determine if the automation is truly energy-saving before scaling.

*Source: [Make product management fun again with AI agents](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/make-product-management-fun-again-with-ai-agents)*

---

**Insight:** Understand the AI agent landscape by evaluating tools based on their specific agentic behaviors rather than generic marketing categories.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use the six-behavior spectrum—proactivity, planning, context, live data, action, and feedback loops—to categorize new tools.
- Identify 'agentic' tools that create their own feedback loops and iterate without human assistance.
- Differentiate between chat-based LLMs and agents by checking if the tool can draw on live data sources like web searches.

## Marc Andreessen

> "Over the holiday break, it feels like the AI coding thing really hit critical mass and the world's best programmers, including Linus Torvalds, for the first time over the holiday break basically said, 'Yeah, AI is now coding better than we can.'"

**Insight:** The arrival of AI-assisted coding has transformed the developer's role from manual execution to high-level reasoning and orchestration.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use AI tools to transition from being a standard programmer to a super-empowered individual with 10x output.
- Harness AI reasoning for complex tasks in coding, science, and math where answers are verifiable.
- Adopt AI coding tools immediately to stay competitive with the world's best programmers who have already hit critical mass.

## Michael Truell

**Insight:** Effective adoption of AI coding tools requires engineers to maintain a deep understanding of the generated code to prevent the system from becoming an unmanageable black box.

**Tactical advice:**
- Avoid 'vibe coding' where code is generated without a thorough understanding of the implementation details.
- Ensure the human engineer remains responsible for specifying the precise logic and intent of the software.
- Use AI as an effortless translation layer to move from high-level intent to code while retaining the ability to edit all details.

## Scott Wu

> "Devin is a fully autonomous software engineer that is going to work on tasks end to end, and so there are a lot of great tools for all parts of the stack of the AI code workflow. What Devin does is it is a full asynchronous workflow, and so you can tag Devin on an issue in Slack, you're talking about an issue and you tag Devin, you can tag Devin in Linear, you can have Devin and Devin will make pull requests in your GitHub, and so it's very much built to work with engineering teams as your junior engineer."

**Insight:** AI coding agents function as autonomous junior engineers that can handle end-to-end tasks asynchronously through standard team communication tools.

**Tactical advice:**
- Assign end-to-end tasks to agents via Slack or issue trackers like Linear.
- Treat agents as asynchronous junior team members rather than just synchronous chatbots.

> "Our whole team is only like 15 engineers a year. We use a ton of Devin when we're building Devin. Most folks on the team are definitely working with up to five Devins at once, and so Devin merges like several hundred pull requests into production in the Devin code bases every month."

**Insight:** Managing multiple AI agents allows an engineer to shift from doing single-task implementation to coordinating a parallel team, significantly increasing personal output.

**Tactical advice:**
- Shift your mindset from synchronous single-tasking to asynchronous coordination of multiple agents.
- Assign distinct tasks to different agent instances simultaneously to multiply your individual engineering throughput.

## Sherwin Wu V2

> "Engineers are becoming tech leads. They're managing fleets and fleets of agents. It literally feels like we're wizards casting all these spells and these spells are kind of like going out and doing things for you."

**Insight:** The role of a software engineer is shifting from manual line-by-line coding to high-level orchestration and management of parallel AI agent threads.

**Tactical advice:**
- Transition from writing code to managing multiple parallel agent threads simultaneously.
- Treat programming languages as incantations used to steer models toward desired outcomes.
- Focus your energy on steering agents and providing feedback rather than manual implementation.

*Source: Sherwin Wu V2 @ 00:03:21*

---

> "There's a team that's actually doing an experiment right now within OpenAI where they are maintaining a 100% Codex-written code base. They run into the exact problems that you're describing. And so usually you're like, 'All right, I'll roll up my sleeves and figure it out.' This team doesn't have that escape hatch."

**Insight:** To master AI-driven development, teams must eliminate manual 'escape hatches' and force themselves to solve code issues through model steering alone.

**Tactical advice:**
- Resist the urge to manually fix code when AI agents struggle or go off-rails.
- Commit to maintaining portions of your codebase using only AI-generated outputs to build steering proficiency.
- Develop seniority by learning to monitor and correct agents before their tasks diverge from the objective.

## Varun Mohan

**Insight:** The most effective way to master AI coding tools is through consistent, hands-on use to identify the specific workflows where they offer the most leverage.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use AI tools daily to build a gut feeling for the 'hills and valleys' of their current capabilities.
- Identify specific repetitive workflows where AI can act as an immediate force multiplier for your output.

## Zevi Arnovitz

> "It's very difficult for me to catch mistakes. What I'll do is basically /review. This tells Claude to start reviewing its own code, but what's even cooler is I have Codex as well as Cursor open. I will have each of them review the code."

**Insight:** Compensate for a lack of coding knowledge by using multiple AI models to peer-review and cross-check each other's technical output.

**Tactical advice:**
- Create a /review command that forces the primary AI to check its own work for logic errors before deployment.
- Keep a second AI model open (like Codex) to provide a 'second opinion' on complex code blocks.
- Treat one model as the dev lead who must defend its code against the critiques raised by the other model.

---

> "Zevi shows you how to work with cursor to quickly add your ideas to Linear to explore your idea with AI, how to develop your plan, how to then build the thing, and then have different LLMs review your code and update your documentation, and then use all of this as a learning opportunity to develop your own sense of how things work."

**Insight:** Iteratively improve your AI development process by turning every error into a prompt or documentation update that prevents the mistake from recurring.

**Tactical advice:**
- When the AI makes a mistake, ask it to reflect on what in its instructions caused the error.
- Update your system prompts and custom /commands immediately after resolving a recurring technical bug.
- Maintain a folder of shared knowledge in your project that the AI must consult before every new task.

> "I'm not sure who he's quoting, but code is just words at the end of the day. So it's just files on your computer. So basically you can be working on the same project and carry it from app to app. And especially now, I can work with multiple models and apps on my project."

**Insight:** Optimize your codebase for AI agency by including plain-text markdown files that explain the structure and navigation to any agent joining the project.

**Tactical advice:**
- Add plain-text .md files throughout your codebase to guide AI agents on how to work in specific directories.
- Keep high-level documentation updated so that any model (Claude, Codex, Gemini) can quickly gain context on the project.
- Use file-based storage to easily move your project between different AI tools and leverage their unique strengths.
