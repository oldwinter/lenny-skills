# PLG Fundamentals - Frameworks, Templates & Checklists

*46 artifacts extracted from Lenny's Podcast and Newsletter*

## Frameworks

### Bottom-Up SaaS Metrics Priority Framework (The most important bottom-up SaaS metrics to track (and how to best visualize them), The most important bottom-up SaaS metrics to track)
A prioritized, stage-based framework for selecting which metrics to track at an early-stage bottom-up SaaS company, divided into pre-revenue, post-revenue, and additional metrics

How it works: **PRE-REVENUE (in priority order):**

1. RETENTION
   - User retention: % of new users still active 3-6 months later
   - Logo retention: % of new companies still active 3-6 months later
   - L7/L30 retention: Number of days users are active per week/month

2. VIRALITY WITHIN AN ORGANIZATION
   - Invite rate: % of new users who sent at least one invite in first X days
   - Invite conversion rate: % of users who receive an invite that sign up in next X days
   - Virality factor: % of new users who came from an invite

3. TOP-OF-FUNNEL GROWTH
   - Traffic: Visits to site/week
   - MoM user growth: Month-over-month growth rate in total users
   - Activation: % new users who 'activate' (product-specific definition)

**POST-REVENUE (in priority order):**

1. REVENUE GROWTH
   - MRR: Total and MoM MRR growth
   - ARR: Total and MoM ARR growth
   - New customers: New customers/week

2. RETENTION
   - Customer retention: % of new paying customers still customers 3-6 months later
   - Net Dollar Retention: MRR of each cohort at 12 months

3. MONETIZATION
   - Paid company conversion: % of free companies that convert to paid within X days
   - Payback period: Average time to pay back CAC
   - Gross margins: Net sales revenue minus COGS

**ADDITIONAL METRICS TO TRACK:**

1. Engagement: DAU/MAU, Key actions per day/week, Average time spent/user/day

2. Virality (advanced): Invite volume (median invites per user), Velocity of virality (median days from 1→N seats), Traction (companies with 3+ users), Leads (top domains with most users)

3. Monetization (advanced): ARPU, User conversion %, Quick ratio ((New MRR + Expansion MRR) / (Contraction MRR + Churned MRR)), Growth spend efficiency (CAC/LTV), Speed to next tier, Company adoption (users per domain)

4. Funnel conversion: Landing conversion (% visitors click CTA), Activation %, % visitors complete signup flow, % visitors signup

### Community-Led Growth Model (Yuhki Yamashata)
Reframing PLG as community-led growth where the company's role is to empower internal champions with data, stories, and a philosophy to evangelize

How it works: Key elements: 1) The face of the product inside a company should be a passionate internal user, not a salesperson. 2) Sales team's role is to empower those champions with data, stories, and connections. 3) Give users a philosophy/new way of working to champion, not just a tool. 4) Create narrative tension (e.g., 'if this is the future of design, I'm quitting'). 5) Build community programs (e.g., Friends of Figma with Discord channels and regular meetups). 6) Enable users to open-source their work (share Figma files showing how their company works).

### Customer 360 Database Question Template (Five steps to starting your product-led growth motion, part 2)
The type of cross-functional question a customer 360 database should be able to answer

How it works: A customer 360 database should enable you to answer complex cross-functional questions like:

'Which features do users A and B from company X use, how many emails did we send them, and is our sales team engaging with them?'

Data sources to connect:
- Product usage data
- Marketing campaigns (Marketo, HubSpot)
- Sales activities (Salesforce)
- Third-party firmographic data (ZoomInfo, Clearbit)

Smart actions enabled by two-way data flow:
- Send feature usage data to Salesforce → sales rep can reference features the prospect used in sales calls
- Send usage data to HubSpot → trigger targeted emails based on feature usage

### Five Steps to Starting Your PLG Motion (Five steps to starting your product-led growth motion, Five steps to starting your product-led growth motion, part 2)
A comprehensive five-step framework for building a product-led growth motion for B2B SaaS products, applicable to both PLG-native and SLG companies layering on PLG

How it works: 1. **Map your funnel:** How should you construct your PLG funnel differently from your sales-led funnel?
2. **Pick a starting point:** Among acquisition, activation, and conversion, where should you focus first to drive the highest ROI for your PLG effort?
3. **Anticipate the common pitfalls:** What are the possible reasons PLG might fail at your company, and what can you do now to avoid them?
4. **Set up the infrastructure:** What are the infrastructure and tools you'll need to enable and accelerate PLG within your organization?
5. **Build your team:** Who specifically should be working on PLG, and where should they sit in the org chart to best align incentives and workflow?

### Five Strategic Reasons for PLG (Five steps to starting your product-led growth motion)
A classification of valid strategic motivations for adding a PLG motion, used to build organizational conviction and commitment

How it works: 1. Efficiency Seeker: Improve sales and marketing efficiency and lower CAC via PLG motion. Many SLG companies add PLG for this reason.

2. Growth Chaser: Unlock more growth and reach new segments, especially SMB. Example: HubSpot went downmarket with PLG.

3. Disruptor: Use freemium and PLG to disrupt established B2B incumbents. Example: Figma disrupted Adobe.

4. Defender: An established SLG enterprise product experiments with PLG on a new product to develop the muscle and defend position. Example: Gainsight experimented with PLG on Gainsight PX (newly acquired analytics tool).

5. PLG Native: PLG is a natural fit for your product (bottom-up SaaS) and you want to grow to large scale via PLG-native approach. Examples: Notion, Canva.

Use these categories to articulate why PLG makes strategic sense for your company and build executive buy-in.

### Four Questions to Evaluate Self-Serve Viability (The Transition: Layering sales onto a bottom-up self-serve product)
A decision framework with four questions to determine if a self-serve go-to-market motion is appropriate for your B2B product

How it works: Ask these four questions:

1. Is the product simple enough for self-serve? Can users reach the 'aha' activation moment on their own? Note: complexity is audience-contingent — technical products can be self-serve if the audience is technical (e.g., Stripe, Datadog for developers).

2. Is this truly new and differentiated? If no incumbent exists in the category, self-serve is fantastic because users have nothing to compare against or switch from (e.g., Calendly, Yesware when first launched).

3. Can this co-exist with a (less good) incumbent in a given company's stack? If your product can live alongside existing tools rather than requiring a rip-and-replace, self-serve works (e.g., Slack alongside GChat, Atrium alongside Tableau). If it's an 'end to end' system where you can't have two (e.g., HRIS, email sending platform), self-serve is harder.

4. Will you focus on small organizations? If none of the above apply, you can still target smaller orgs that haven't yet adopted a legacy provider (e.g., Stripe targeting new internet businesses, RevOps targeting 10-person sales orgs).

If at least one of these is true, self-serve is likely viable as a starting motion.

### Free-to-Paid Conversion Formula and Measurement Method (What is good free-to-paid conversion)
The standard formula and best practice for measuring free-to-paid conversion on a cohort basis

How it works: Formula: Free-to-paid conversion = [new accounts who begin paying within their first 6 months] / [total new accounts created during the measurement window]. Best practices: (1) Measure on a cohort basis to tell whether you're getting sequentially better vs. pulling forward conversion. (2) Use a 6-month conversion window. (3) Define at account level (single user or collection of users). (4) Monitor conversion rates across different audiences, not only the blended rate.

### Free-to-Paid Conversion Rate Benchmarks (What is good free-to-paid conversion)
Definitive benchmark ranges for B2B SaaS free-to-paid conversion rates segmented by product model type, based on 1,000+ product survey

How it works: Freemium Self-Serve: GOOD = 3%-5%, GREAT = 6%-8% (examples: Canva, Trello, Typeform). Freemium with Sales-Assist: GOOD = 5%-7%, GREAT = 10%-15% (examples: Airtable, GitLab, HubSpot). Free Trial: GOOD = 8%-12%, GREAT = 15%-25% (examples: Shopify, Google Workspace, Intercom). Reverse Trial: Converts at 2x the rate of classic freemium with similar sign-up rates (only 5% of respondents use this model). Additional data points: Sign-up rates for free-trial products are materially lower than freemium (5% vs 9%). Developer-focused companies have median conversion rate of 5%, half that of non-developer-focused companies. Larger customer targets = lower free-to-paid conversion. No statistically significant differences found based on company revenue, YoY growth rate, or horizontal vs. vertical app.

### GTM Terminology Definitions (GTM motions of 30 B2B SaaS companies)
Clear definitions of key B2B SaaS go-to-market terms including product-led, sales-led, top-down, bottom-up, sales assist, and bottom-up lead gen

How it works: Product-led: The product is self-serve (freemium or trial), users become customers after using the product on their own. Discovery via SEO, ads, or referrals. Examples: Figma, Datadog, Airtable.

Sales-led: Product requires someone from the company (usually a salesperson) to onboard you. New customers try the product only after a salesperson reaches out. Examples: Workday, Snowflake, Salesforce.

Top-down: Target leaders (execs, VPs, heads-of) who buy and spread product throughout the company top-down. Examples: Workday, Carta, Square.

Bottom-up: Target individual contributors who spread the product bottom-up, eventually enabling companywide sales and expansion. Examples: Datadog, GitHub, Coda.

Sales assist: A sales team helps close and expand larger accounts that primarily come through a product-led motion (vs. outbound sales).

Bottom-up lead gen: A sales-led company with a self-serve product primarily designed to drive leads to the sales team (not generate revenue).

Business segments:
- VSB (very small business): <10 employees
- SMB (small or midsize business): 10-99 employees
- Mid-market: 100-1,000 employees
- Enterprise: >1,000 employees

### PLG Fitness Assessment (Summary: The ultimate guide to adding a PLG motion | Hila Qu (Reforge, GitLab))
Criteria for evaluating whether your business is suited for PLG, presented as a spectrum

How it works: PLG is likely a GOOD fit if:
- Product can deliver value without extensive customization
- Large addressable market of potential users
- Product has collaboration or viral components
- Users can experience value independently
- Target customers include SMB/mid-market segments

PLG is likely a POOR fit if:
- Product requires extensive customization for customer to see value
- Targeting only a handful of large companies (e.g., defense companies with 3 target customers)
- Product value is only realized at organizational scale

Key insight: PLG is a spectrum, not binary. Most B2B software companies fall in the middle and can benefit from integrating elements of PLG.

### PLG Funnel Framework (Lauryn Isford)
A 4-step framework for mapping the product-led growth customer journey and structuring growth teams.

How it works: 1. Join (signing up or being invited). 2. Evaluate (experiencing value/aha moment - deliberately not called 'onboard'). 3. Upgrade (converting to paid/premium). 4. Expand (more users in the organization adopting the tool, driving net dollar retention and new 'Joins').

### PLG Growth Lever Prioritization (Summary: The ultimate guide to adding a PLG motion | Hila Qu (Reforge, GitLab))
Decision framework for choosing which PLG lever to invest in first based on your product's current state

How it works: Priority order and when to focus on each:

1. Activation (START HERE): If users enter the product but don't know what to do next. Identify aha moment metric → design product experience to help more people get there. Use warm starts (templates, samples).

2. Self-service Conversion: If activation is solid but conversion is low. Benchmark against e-commerce (Amazon, Lululemon). Fix confusing checkout, pricing pages, regional payment issues.

3. PQL/PQA (Product Qualified Leads/Accounts): Invest after activation and self-checkout are working. Requires reasonable user base and cross-functional coordination (sales, marketing, data).

4. Product-led Acquisition: If your product has inherent viral/collaboration components. Think Figma, Calendly, Airtable — build features that allow the product to spread on its own.

### PLG Infrastructure Three Pillars (Five steps to starting your product-led growth motion, part 2)
The three must-have infrastructure components every PLG company needs before they can run a PLG motion effectively

How it works: Three critical infrastructure pieces:

1. **Data Infrastructure** - Two components:
   a. Product analytics tools and data instrumentation (e.g., Amplitude, Mixpanel) — requires dedicated engineering resources for proper tracking
   b. Customer 360 database — connects product usage, marketing campaigns (Marketo, HubSpot), sales activities (Salesforce), and third-party firmographic data (ZoomInfo, Clearbit) into a central database with two-way data pipelines (data warehouse, CDP, ETL, reverse ETL)

2. **Experimentation Platform** — Maturity journey:
   - Stage 1: Manual experimentation
   - Stage 2: Third-party tools (Optimizely, VWO, Eppo) — recommended starting point
   - Stage 3: Homegrown platform — only when scale justifies the investment
   Key advice: Don't skip the 'buy' phase and jump to 'build'

3. **Lifecycle Marketing Tools** — Shift from lead-nurturing (Marketo/HubSpot) to usage-driven lifecycle messaging (Customer.io, Braze) across email, in-app messages, push notifications, and SMS

### PLG Marketing Advantages Over Traditional B2B (Product-led marketing)
Two structural advantages that PLG companies have in their marketing approach

How it works: 1. Wider funnel: PLG companies can target USERS rather than executive buyers. There could be hundreds of end users in an account for every one executive, opening the aperture of who you can target.

2. Earlier buying journey: PLG lowers the entry barrier to trying your product. Users get started for free, see tangible value, then advocate for wider adoption. You reach users before they're in a formal buying process.

### PLG Readiness Diagnostic Questions (Five steps to starting your product-led growth motion)
Two key diagnostic questions to assess whether your organization has the data foundation and expertise to support PLG

How it works: Question 1 (Data Foundation): Assuming you have a free product, do you have the data to track: (a) how many free users sign up, (b) which features they use most, and (c) which usage pattern correlates with a higher free-to-paid conversion rate?
If no → Build PLG data infrastructure first. No way around it.

Question 2 (PLG Expertise): Assuming you have the data and metrics, do you know concepts like 'team aha moment' and 'product qualified leads (PQL),' and do you have frameworks to get users/customers to reach this status?
If no → You lack PLG expertise and talent in-house. Follow the three-phase talent approach.

### PLG Starting Point Selection: Acquisition, Activation, or Conversion (Five steps to starting your product-led growth motion)
Framework for choosing the initial focus area of your PLG investment based on the biggest constraint in your growth model

How it works: Ask: What is the biggest constraint — and potential unlock — in your growth model?

1. Product-led Acquisition: Focus here if you have a small user base or your product has inherent viral/network-effect components. Goal: use product to generate more users/leads scalably. Benefit: once established, no ongoing spend on ads or outbound.

2. Product-led Activation: Focus here if you have users but they're not reaching the aha moment. Always an area with tons of opportunity. Two-step approach: (a) Define the aha moment (user, team, buyer, paid-customer), (b) Use multi-channel approach.

3. Product-led Conversion: Focus here if you have active free users but low monetization. Two options: self-service conversion and PQLs. Can directly impact ARR.

4. Retention/Expansion: Valid but don't start here due to complexity. Tackle after acquisition/activation/conversion.

Tip: Start with areas that have the most low-hanging fruit for immediate impact to boost organizational confidence.

### PLG vs SLG Funnel Comparison (Five steps to starting your product-led growth motion, Summary: The ultimate guide to adding a PLG motion | Hila Qu (Reforge, GitLab))
Side-by-side comparison of sales-led and product-led funnels showing how the middle of the funnel differs

How it works: Sales-Led Funnel (SLG): 1) Marketing attracts visitors → 2) Visitors become leads → 3) Lead scoring based on marketing engagement (email opens, webinar attendance) → 4) Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) handed to sales → 5) Sales works to close deals → Revenue.

Product-Led Funnel (PLG): 1) Visitors sign up for free version/trial → 2) Users engage with product (primary success indicator is product usage) → 3) Two conversion paths: (a) Self-service purchase: user buys online without sales interaction (lower-cost products), (b) Sales-assisted: if user fits ideal customer profile (e.g., Fortune 500), sales/CS reaches out for larger deal → Revenue.

Key difference: SLG qualifies based on marketing engagement; PLG qualifies based on product usage.

### PLG vs SLG Motion Decision Framework (Five steps to starting your product-led growth motion)
A two-factor framework for deciding whether to start with PLG or SLG based on target customer segment and product complexity

How it works: Factor 1: Target customer segment
Factor 2: Product complexity

PLG best fit: Prosumers (e.g. Evernote, Dropbox) or SMBs (e.g. Mailchimp, GoDaddy). Low average customer value, large user base. PLG may be the only viable efficient growth path.

SLG best fit: Enterprise accounts with high price points requiring extensive customization and configuration (e.g. Salesforce — average implementation takes 3 weeks to months). Long time-to-value makes PLG not viable.

In between (majority of B2B SaaS): Start with one motion and layer the other. Examples: Canva and Slack started PLG → added SLG. HubSpot and GitLab started SLG → added PLG.

### Product-Led Acquisition (PLA) Categories (Julian Shapiro)
A mental model for categorizing how products grow organically through natural use.

How it works: Four categories: 1) Settling debts (e.g., PayPal, Venmo), 2) Conversations (e.g., Slack, WhatsApp), 3) Billboarding (e.g., Hotmail signatures, Calendly links, Apple AirPods), 4) User-Generated Content (e.g., TikTok watermarks, Quora SEO).

### Three B2B Early Sales Strategies (How today's fastest-growing B2B businesses turned their early users into paying customers – Issue 36, How today's fastest-growing B2B startups turned their early users into paying customers)
A framework categorizing the three strategies fastest-growing B2B companies used to convert early users into paying customers

How it works: Strategy 1: Bottom-up + self-service — Users discover product, sign up for free plan, love it, upgrade themselves for more functionality. Companies: Segment, Figma, Slack, Shopify, Stripe, Atlassian, Canva, Twilio, Plaid.

Strategy 2: Bottom-up + inside sales — Users discover product, sign up for free plan, then are encouraged by a sales rep or proactively reach out to upgrade. Companies: Dropbox, Asana, Airtable, Box, New Relic, Coda.

Strategy 3: Outbound sales — Founders or early sales hires reach out to leads, help them trial the product, and sign them up for a paid plan. Companies: Zoom, Carta, Amplitude, Okta, Intercom, Gusto, Square, Looker, Salesforce.

Key insight: All three strategies eventually converge — 100% of companies built a sales team regardless of starting strategy.

### Three Characteristics of a PLG Product (Summary: The ultimate guide to adding a PLG motion | Hila Qu (Reforge, GitLab))
Framework for evaluating whether a product exhibits product-led growth characteristics, using Zoom as the canonical example

How it works: 1. Low barrier to entry: Free version or free trial; users can start without boss approval or prior knowledge.
2. Self-service checkout flow: Users can upgrade to paid plans and access advanced features on their own without sales team.
3. Product spreads on its own: Nature of the product encourages organic growth and word of mouth; users who find value share it with others.

### Three Prerequisites for PLG Success (Summary: The ultimate guide to adding a PLG motion | Hila Qu (Reforge, GitLab))
The three foundational requirements any company needs before pursuing a PLG strategy

How it works: 1. Vehicle: A free version, free trial, open-source product, or realistic product experience that gives potential users a taste of value.

2. Time to Value: Ability to provide value quickly. Give users a 'warm start' — sample content, templates, tutorials — to help them get started immediately.

3. Data Foundation: Product usage data instrumented so you can design user journeys (in-product, via email, or other tools) to guide users to the next step.

### Two Buckets of PLG Data (Summary: The ultimate guide to adding a PLG motion | Hila Qu (Reforge, GitLab))
The two essential categories of data needed to power a PLG motion

How it works: Bucket 1 - Product Usage Data: Tracking and analyzing user behaviors, feature usage, and engagement patterns. In traditional sales-led B2B, granular usage data hasn't been crucial. In PLG, it's essential for understanding what drives engagement, retention, and conversion.

Bucket 2 - Customer 360 Database: Comprehensive view integrating data from multiple sources — product usage data + marketing campaign data + CRM data + sales data. Goal: form a complete 360-degree picture of the customer journey from initial contact through product engagement to conversion.

## Checklists

### Data Audit Process for PLG (Summary: The ultimate guide to adding a PLG motion | Hila Qu (Reforge, GitLab))
Step-by-step process to audit your data infrastructure readiness for PLG

How it works: Step 1: Identify key actions in your product experience (the most important user behaviors you need to track).

Step 2: Match key actions to your current data instrumentation — what's being tracked, what's not.

Step 3: Find gaps — actions that should be tracked but aren't, or are tracked incorrectly.

Step 4: Check data formats — are events named consistently? Are properties structured correctly?

Step 5: Re-instrument or reformat where needed to make data useful for product analytics.

Step 6: Establish a data dictionary containing all key actions, event names, properties, etc. to standardize understanding across the team.

Step 7: When gaining data users at scale, set up a data warehouse (AWS Redshift recommended) and ETL solution. Early-stage companies can use Google Analytics or Amplitude, but growth requires more robust infrastructure.

Principle: 'Garbage in, garbage out' — audit data quality before implementing tools.

### Five Common PLG Pitfalls Diagnostic (Five steps to starting your product-led growth motion)
A diagnostic checklist of the five most common pitfalls when adding PLG, with identification criteria and solutions

How it works: Pitfall #1: Lack of commitment and investment
- Symptom: Company wants PLG but commits no meaningful resources
- Solution: Identify clear strategic reason (see Five Strategic Reasons), commit to 1-2 year investment in roadmap, team, and infrastructure

Pitfall #2: Product is not ready
- Symptom: Only CTAs are 'request a trial' or 'book a demo'; no free trial or free version exists
- Solution: Open free trial to everyone or create a free version. If resistance, start as an experiment with time-boxed free trial and measure impact

Pitfall #3: Lack of data infrastructure and foundation
- Symptom: Can't answer: How many free users sign up? Which features do they use most? Which usage patterns correlate with conversion?
- Solution: Hire right growth/data leader, commit resources to collect and analyze data. No shortcut.

Pitfall #4: Lack of PLG expertise and talent
- Symptom: Team doesn't know concepts like 'team aha moment' or 'PQL' or frameworks to reach them
- Solution: Three-phase approach: (1) Hire PLG advisor with relevant industry experience, (2) Identify internal talent with passion/analytical skills, (3) Hire external growth leader once PLG is validated

Pitfall #5: Resistance from current teams
- Symptom: Sales worried about quota/commission impact; marketing worried PQLs take credit from MQLs; growth team struggles to fit into GTM workflows
- Solution: Executive buy-in + functional leader alignment. Eventually align on funnel, metrics, org design, and incentives.

### Five Steps to Starting Your Product-Led Growth Motion (The Best of Lenny’s Newsletter 2023)
A five-step process for B2B companies to begin implementing product-led growth.

How it works: A structured five-step guide for B2B SaaS companies to start their product-led growth motion. Paired with a podcast episode featuring Hila Qu (Reforge, GitLab). Steps guide companies from evaluating PLG fit through implementation.

### Five-Step Process to Find PLG Leverage (Summary: The ultimate guide to adding a PLG motion | Hila Qu (Reforge, GitLab))
The sequential steps to take after mapping your PLG funnel to find and exploit the biggest growth opportunities

How it works: 1. Establish the Fundamental Components: Build foundational pieces — clear marketing site, free version/trial, smooth checkout process.

2. Identify the Starting Point: Choose the part of your funnel where a small investment could yield substantial results.

3. Conduct a Full Funnel Audit: Run through the entire user journey as a customer — website visit, sign-up, initial product use, purchasing process — to find bottlenecks and pain points.

4. Address Pain Points: Proactively fix issues like confusing checkout forms or unclear paths to the aha moment.

5. Prioritize User Onboarding: Ensure users can quickly reach the aha moment to prevent drop-off from confusion or frustration.

### Modular PLG Assessment (Christopher Miller)
A set of questions to determine if and where a product should apply a product-led growth motion.

How it works: Questions to ask: Who is the customer? How do they prefer to buy? Is it a top-down or bottoms-up decision? How complex are the billing and subscription terms? Are they comfortable with the technology? Are we competing against non-consumption or established competitors?

### PLG Funnel Audit Checklist (Hila Qu)
A step-by-step evaluation to find friction in a product's self-serve journey.

How it works: 1. Does the landing page pull you in? 2. Can you sign up and use it on your own smoothly? 3. Do you get to the aha moment quickly without confusion? 4. Can you easily find where to buy and complete self-checkout? 5. Are the initial onboarding emails helpful in bringing you back?

### PLG Funnel Mapping Steps (Summary: The ultimate guide to adding a PLG motion | Hila Qu (Reforge, GitLab))
Step-by-step process for mapping out the major components of your PLG funnel

How it works: Step 1 - Marketing Site: Where potential users first learn about the product. Messaging should encourage free sign-ups.

Step 2 - Free Version: Give users a taste of what the product can do. UX should guide users toward the product's three most important features.

Step 3 - Checkout Flow: Should be smooth and offer various payment options to accommodate customers from all regions.

After mapping broad components, dive deeper to identify specific details to optimize or maximize in each step.

6. Recommended PLG podcast episodes: HubSpot, GitLab, Canva (OV BUILD podcast), From PLG to SLG (Drift Growth podcast), Product-led sales with Elena Verna (Lenny's Podcast)

### PLG Marketing Idea Vetting Questions (Product-led marketing)
Three questions to evaluate whether a product-led marketing idea is worth pursuing

How it works: Before rolling out a product-led marketing campaign, ask:
1. Will this appeal to the target users of my product?
2. Where is there white space that other folks haven't addressed in my market?
3. How strong is the connection between these campaigns and what my product actually does?

### PLG Viability Criteria (Merci Grace)
A mental checklist to determine if a product can successfully use a product-led growth motion.

How it works: 1. Can an individual contributor (IC) adopt it without needing HR/Admin keys? 2. Is there day-zero value (immediate utility without waiting months for data accumulation)? 3. Can it be used without a mandatory sales conversation or webinar?

### Three Common Pitfalls in Adding PLG (Summary: The ultimate guide to adding a PLG motion | Hila Qu (Reforge, GitLab))
A checklist of the most common mistakes companies make when trying to add a PLG motion

How it works: Pitfall 1 - Not making product accessible: Your biggest CTA is 'book demo' — you need a free product, free trial, or low-barrier entry point for anyone to try.

Pitfall 2 - Not committing to the process: Companies think a 3-month free trial will magically bring leads and conversions. PLG is a complete motion requiring a well-thought-out roadmap spanning a year or more.

Pitfall 3 - Going free without going data-led: Offering free without collecting usage data means you're giving away your product for nothing. The two returns from free are: (a) broader reach and (b) user data.

## Examples

### Atlassian's R&D vs. Sales Spend Strategy (Carilu Dietrich)
A financial allocation strategy where Atlassian spent 2-3x more on R&D than competitors while keeping sales and marketing spend extremely low.

How it works: Instead of funding a large outbound sales organization, Atlassian plowed capital into product and engineering to build a self-serve, product-led growth engine. Sales was reserved primarily for renewals and enterprise assistance, avoiding the high cost of net-new prospecting.

### Enterprise B2B Closed-to-Open Trial Transition (Five steps to starting your product-led growth motion)
Real example from a security B2B company marketing leader on moving from closed trials (ICP-only) to open trials as a first step toward PLG

How it works: Context: Leading security B2B company with closed trials only open to end users in their ICP (100+ employees). Resellers, service providers, and tech partners had separate processes.

Approach: Convinced company to open up to end users slightly outside ICP (e.g. under 100 employees).

Rationale: While they can't monetize non-ICP users at the same rate, they can learn about product usage and there might be a path to monetize.

Key insight from the leader: 'The enterprise B2B sales cycle and PLG are inherently at odds — one is a very controlled experience and the other is not. In a PLG motion, your product is shaping the perception as opposed to the salesperson, so it's simply getting used to giving up that initial control.'

Tip: If facing resistance, start PLG as an experiment — open a free trial for a limited time and measure impact on signups, leads, and upgrades. Use real data to drive the discussion.

### Equals Freemium Experiment Timeline (Lessons from going freemium: a decision that broke our business)
A detailed chronological case study of Equals going freemium, the experiments they ran, the metrics impact, and the recovery

How it works: Timeline:

1. Launch (April 2022): High-friction onboarding — required onboarding call + upfront payment + data source connection. No trial, no self-serve. Revenue took off.

2. Series A (5 months later, ~Sept 2022): Raised $16M from a16z based on strong traction.

3. Freemium Launch (Nov 2022, Series A announcement): Removed onboarding call requirement, slashed prices, introduced generous free plan. Still required data source connection. North Star shifted from ARR to weekly active companies.

Results: 4x'd daily/weekly active companies immediately (pent-up demand from waitlist). Then stalled over next few months — couldn't grow active company base. For every new company, someone dropped off.

4. Experiment 1 — CSV upload option: Allowed users to upload CSV instead of connecting live data source. Result: MORE people reached the product, but FEWER became engaged/retained users. Actually LOST people who would have otherwise connected a live data source.

5. Experiment 2 — Skip data source entirely: Let users bypass data source setup. Added setup guides, in-product nudges, follow-up messages. Result: Awful. Did not increase engagement.

6. Recovery — Kill free, add friction: Introduced 14-day free trial with credit card required upfront + data source requirement. Self-serve maintained (no sales call required).

Results: ARR and customers almost immediately bounced back. Deeply engaged users went UP. Same number of new company signups, but better activation, conversion, and retention. Did not force existing free users to pay.

### Figma's Free Editor Invitation Model (Product-led marketing)
Figma's approach to allowing free editor invitations without blocking virality, with transparent billing controls

How it works: Figma's approach to minimizing friction:
- New editors can be invited for free at any time (no gates blocking invitations)
- Team admins receive an email before payment each month
- Email recaps what the bill will be and highlights any new editors
- Admins can downgrade editors to viewers to avoid extra costs
- Key principle: Don't block the ability to invite — manage billing transparency instead

### Hackathon Sponsorship PLG Playbook (Elena Verna 4.0)
A strategy for driving enterprise adoption by sponsoring internal company hackathons with free product credits.

How it works: Instead of spending on Google Ads, give away free API/usage credits to users hosting internal hackathons. Treat the LLM pass-through costs as a marketing/acquisition expense to create internal champions.

### MongoDB PLG Tiger Team to CloudAtlas (Five steps to starting your product-led growth motion, part 2)
How MongoDB started PLG with a cross-functional tiger team that evolved into a new SaaS freemium offering

How it works: MongoDB's PLG exploration started with a cross-functional tiger team (pulling together existing team members from product, marketing, sales, and data with support resources in design and engineering). This tiger team approach was used because they needed to tackle larger PLG initiatives requiring cross-functional collaboration. The team eventually evolved their work into a new SaaS freemium offering called CloudAtlas.

### PLG Data Infrastructure Examples (Netlify, Mixpanel, Unity) (Five steps to starting your product-led growth motion, part 2)
Three real-world examples of PLG data infrastructure built by product teams

How it works: Three referenced examples of PLG data infrastructure:
1. **Netlify** — Data team's data pipeline using Census for operational analytics (Netlify blog)
2. **Mixpanel** — Data analytics stack for product-led growth (Mixpanel blog)
3. **Unity** — Building a PLG data/product analytics stack (OpenView blog)

Netlify's data pipeline specifically illustrates the two-way data flow between product analytics, marketing tools, sales tools, and a centralized data warehouse.

How it works: Successful freemium SaaS companies mentioned:
- Notion
- Figma
- Airtable
- Canva
- Miro
- Loom
- AWS (free tier)
- MongoDB (free tier)
- Sanity (free tier)

Characteristics that enable their success:

- Free users contribute to growth via viral loops and network effects (Loom: every shared video creates new potential users; Miro: collaboration drives adoption)

## Tools

### Organizational Spread Node Graph (Claire Butler)
An internal data visualization tool used to track how a product spreads from a single user to an entire organization.

How it works: Maps 'patient zero' at a company and visualizes the invitation tree (Gen 1, Gen 2 users) to identify internal champions and clusters of adoption across different departments.

### PLG Data and Tool Stack (Hila Qu)

### PLG Tool Stack Recommendations (Summary: The ultimate guide to adding a PLG motion | Hila Qu (Reforge, GitLab))
Complete tool stack for implementing a PLG motion, organized by infrastructure and specific PLG areas

How it works: INFRASTRUCTURE TOOLS:
1. Data Collection/Hub: Segment — collect, clean, and control customer data; enables easy integration with many tools
2. Product Analytics: Amplitude, PostHog (open-source), Mixpanel, Pandle — understand how users interact with product
3. Experimentation: Optimizely, Eppo, or Amplitude (has experimentation component) — A/B testing and experimentation
4. Lifecycle Marketing: Tools for personalizing engagement based on product behavior (distinct from lead nurturing tools focused on marketing material engagement)

ADDITIONAL PLG-SPECIFIC TOOLS:
5. Data Enrichment: ZoomInfo, Clearbit — provide additional data about user's company (critical for B2B)
6. Onboarding: Appcues, User-Led — quick creation of onboarding flows without heavy engineering
7. Conversion (PQL/PQA): Endgame, Pocus, Toplyne, Pace — insights and automation for converting product-qualified leads/accounts

Starting recommendation: Begin with product analytics tool + data hub (Segment). Data hub's flexibility allows trial and error without significant commitment.
