# Shipping Velocity - Frameworks, Templates & Checklists

*40 artifacts extracted from Lenny's Podcast and Newsletter*

## Frameworks

### 10 Tactics to Motivate Engineers (and Anyone) to Ship (This Week #4: Motivating engineers to hit deadlines, PM career ladders, and aligning with execs)
A comprehensive framework of 10 motivational levers PMs can pull to increase team velocity and deadline adherence

How it works: 1. Connect work to personal motivations — Find each person's individual goals (become a manager, start a company, get promoted). Help them see how the current project builds skills toward that goal. Make it explicit.
2. Connect work to the higher mission — Make it clear how day-to-day work connects to the company mission. Do this in team meetings, project kickoffs, 1-Pagers, decks, and 1:1s.
3. Partner with their manager — As a PM, your influence is limited. Work with eng managers to change behavior. Help them see what you see. A good relationship with the eng manager is critical.
4. Make sure you have buy-in — Ask team members how long they expect something to take. It's OK to push back occasionally, but generally trust them. Work out sequencing based on direct estimates, confirm everyone feels good, lock it in, and share widely. Check in during regular syncs.
5. Align incentives — Sub-tactics:
   a. Connect impact to performance reviews — shipping impact on business should reflect on performance
   b. Status — publicly celebrate hitting deadlines; be careful not to punish misses (causes padding/crappy code)
   c. Autonomy — more reliable delivery → more freedom and autonomy going forward
   d. Financial — hitting dates → more likely promoted → raises; occasional spot-bonuses help too
   e. Peer pressure — missing dates means letting down the team and customers
6. Align passions — Ensure people work on things they're excited about (e.g., building mastery in ML, React, growth, or filling gaps needed for promotion).
7. Align skill-sets — Make sure people are suited for the work. If they're still learning, lean on senior team members to ramp them up faster.
8. Sprints — Switch to agile with 2-week estimation windows. People are bad at long-range estimation.
9. Change the deadline when you have new information — When unexpected hurdles emerge, officially reset the deadline. Get buy-in again and share widely.
10. Sometimes, fire people — After exhausting other options and being clear about underperformance, sometimes letting people go is best for everyone.

### 15 Strategies to Increase Team Velocity (Increasing team velocity)
A comprehensive framework of 15 concrete strategies for increasing team velocity, organized as a menu to pick 1-2 from and experiment with over a month or quarter

How it works: 15 strategies to increase team velocity:

1. 🔎 Narrow your team's focus — The fewer things you focus on, the better those remaining things will go.
2. 🛡 Protect deep work time — Extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction.
3. 🤝 Sync more regularly to align on priorities and unblock blockers — Keep meetings short, focused, and decision-oriented.
4. 👎 Fire underperformers — Sometimes the hardest thing is the right thing.
5. 🗣 Encourage more communication between team members — A quick call/DM can save days of wasted time.
6. ✍️ Facilitate async communication — For non-timely questions, make async communication easy and normal.
7. 👀 Loop engineers (and other team members) in earlier — More context = more motivation, proactivity, creativity, and less lost in translation.
8. 💪 Empower your cross-functional teams — Form cross-functional teams with all resources necessary to ship, empower them to drive outcomes.
9. 🤲 Nurture psychological safety — Google's research: psychological safety is the #1 factor in great teams.
10. 🤝 Align on what success for the team means — Teams rowing in the same direction move faster.
11. 🤔 Anticipate risks and edge-cases — A bit more planning up-front saves pain later.
12. 🔁 Switch your product development process — Experiment with new processes to find better ways of working.
13. 👩‍💻 Optimize your code review process — Talk to engineers about speeding up review, approval, and deployment.
14. ⚙️ Invest in unit testing — More confidence in code = faster changes and shipping.
15. 🥇 Hire more people — Sometimes the answer is simple: more (great) people.

Implementation approach: Review the list with your leadership team, pick 1-2 strategies, spend the next month/quarter putting them into action. Evaluate results. If they work, great. If not, try something else. Keep experimenting.

### Anti-Perfectionism Mantras (Julia Schottenstein)
Two sayings used to encourage shipping and learning over over-engineering.

How it works: 'Worse is better' (ship a naive version to learn from users) and 'Tech debt is a champagne problem' (having tech debt means people are actually using your product at scale).

### BigCo Status Quo vs. Startup Mindset Framework (How to ship like a startup)
A seven-part framework contrasting default BigCo behaviors with startup mindset alternatives for shipping products faster. Each of the seven strategies is framed as a BigCo status quo to replace with a startup mindset.

How it works: Seven contrasts:
1. BigCo: Write detailed PRDs → Startup: Replace PRDs with prototypes, speed and experimentation over documentation
2. BigCo: Hide WIP to avoid scrutiny → Startup: Build hype by working in the open, share behind-the-scenes progress
3. BigCo: PMs own only the product → Startup: Build a cult(ure) so strong it feels borderline religious
4. BigCo: People work on assigned products → Startup: Find believers who opt in rather than swaying skeptics
5. BigCo: Teams stay in their lanes with handoffs → Startup: Make every team member a product owner, everyone is a part-time PM
6. BigCo: Only researchers talk to users → Startup: Remove the wall, everyone engages with users
7. BigCo: Only work on assigned projects → Startup: Earn trust with meat and potatoes, then sprint on any idea (your soufflé)

### Circuit Breaker principle (Ryan Singer)
If a project is not on track to finish at the end of its time box, don't just extend the deadline — stop building and bring it back to shaping mode to understand what's fuzzy or what was missed.

How it works: Original Basecamp version: Cancel the project entirely and rethink. Real-life version (more stomachable): 1) Don't keep reinvesting in something you don't understand. 2) Pull it out of build mode. 3) Bring it back to shaping mode with possibly different people. 4) Ask: What's fuzzy? What couldn't we see? What do we not understand? 5) Re-shape with clarity, then give it another whack.

### Cross-Functional Pairing Model (0% to 100% Together) (How to ship like a startup)
Figma's approach to eliminating handoff culture by having PM, design, and engineering work together from start to finish

How it works: Two key practices:

1. Remove the black box around product and design process:
- Engineers shouldn't be kept in the dark until handoff
- Involve engineers early for better context and decision-making
- Bring engineers into design syncs where product decisions are being made
- Result: Design proposals already informed by engineering feasibility; engineers proactively contribute insights rather than just executing specs

2. Go from 0% to 100% together:
- Teams don't work in silos—they pair on solutions
- PMs and designers jam together in a Figma file
- Handoffs between design and engineering are real-time pairing sessions
- Tweak interactions and refine details together
- Result: Stronger product, fewer roadblocks, team feels true ownership

### Customer Love Sprints (Noah Weiss)
A dedicated two-week sprint focused entirely on shipping low-effort, high-impact delightful features.

How it works: Run once a quarter for user-facing teams. Operates like a hackathon but with a pre-defined burndown list of UX improvements. Goal is to ship all items to production by the end of the two weeks.

### Deliver Customer Value Faster with High Quality (Varun Parmar)
Miro's product org motto that serves as the foundation for performance evaluation, measurement, and team alignment—with three measurable attributes

How it works: Three attributes: 1) Deliver Customer Value: Value is only delivered when customers use it. Measure: Did the target metric move? Compare actuals to original targets set before work began. 2) Faster: Track cycle times from insight → pitch → ship → metric movement. Benchmark S/M/L projects across all teams. Velocity is like golf—you compete against yourself. 3) High Quality: Monthly binary triage by design leadership of everything shipped (high quality / not high quality). Benchmark against best-in-class apps for specific interaction patterns (sharing flows, sync capabilities, etc.). This motto is embedded in the evaluation rubric and reward system.

### Hard vs Soft Deadlines Framework (This Week #4: Motivating engineers to hit deadlines, PM career ladders, and aligning with execs)
A framework for being transparent about deadline types and using each strategically

How it works: Two types of deadlines:
- Arbitrary/Soft deadlines: Be upfront that they are arbitrary. Say 'Let's come up with an arbitrary deadline!' Benefits: helps get more stuff done, coordinates cross-functional deliverables around a unified date, coordinates sales training/CX rollouts, creates some accountability.
- Hard deadlines: Sometimes deadlines are actually important (e.g., external commitments, coordinated launches).

Strategy: Alternate between the two. Use soft deadlines to help the team build muscle in accurate estimation so they're ready when hard deadlines matter. Always be upfront about which type you're using.

### Hill Charts (Jason Fried)
A visual method for tracking project progress based on certainty rather than task completion.

How it works: Work is visualized as a hill. The left side represents pushing uphill (figuring out how to do the work/unknowns). The right side represents downhill (pure execution/knowns).

### Industry Benchmarks for Core 4 Metrics (Introducing Core 4: The best way to measure and improve your product velocity)
External benchmarks across 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles for Core 4 key metrics, used to contextualize team performance.

How it works: Benchmark data (percentile values referenced but specific numbers shown in the newsletter's benchmark image):

Metrics benchmarked:
- PR Throughput (PRs per engineer per week)
- PR Cycle Time
- Deployment Frequency
- Change Failure Rate
- Developer Experience Index (DXI)
- Percentage of time on new capabilities

Recommendation: Target 75th percentile values as initial comparison point. Being a top-quartile performer is a solid goal.

Full benchmarking data download (including segments by company size, sector, and mobile engineers): https://getdx.com/research/benchmarks/

Key research finding: Improving DXI by 1 point = 13 minutes saved/week/developer (based on data from 40,000 developers across 800 organizations)

### Is it maximally accelerated? (Nick Turley)
A thought exercise and cultural meme used to cut through blockers and identify the critical path for product development.

How it works: Ask 'If this was the most important thing and you wanted to truly maximally accelerate it, what would you do?' to force prioritization. Represented internally by a pink Comic Sans Slack emoji.

### One Click Faster Clock Speed (Claire Vo)
A mental model and leadership expectation for artificially accelerating project timelines.

How it works: If a task is planned for this year, pull it to this half. If this half, pull to this quarter. If this quarter, this month. If this month, this week. If this week, today. If today, end of this meeting.

### One Marketable Feature Per Week (Gaurav Misra)
A scoping and shipping methodology where every engineer must deliver a feature that could independently attract users to the app, achieved by ruthlessly cutting scope.

How it works: 1. Identify a 'marketable' feature (something unique enough that a user would download the app just for it). 2. Look at the design and ask, 'If we remove this element, is the product still useful?' 3. Repeat step 2 until removing anything else makes the feature useless. 4. Ship this bare-bones core in one week. 5. Monitor user complaints to dictate the exact features to build in week two.

### Parallel-First Project Execution (How Perplexity builds product)
A method for executing product projects by breaking them into parallel, self-contained tasks to minimize coordination overhead and maximize speed

How it works: Steps: 1) Break the project down into parallel tasks as much as possible to reduce coordination issues (done in Linear by the PM or project lead). 2) Each task should be self-contained — executable without blockers from other tasks. 3) Accept that you'll have to make some controversial decisions along the way — work through controversy later. 4) Hold a quick kickoff meeting for initial alignment. 5) After kickoff, iteration happens asynchronously — no constraints or formal review processes. 6) Design, front end, back end, and business all work simultaneously on the same project rather than waiting sequentially. 7) When individuals feel ready for feedback, they share in Slack for honest and constructive feedback. 8) Iteration happens organically. 9) Product doesn't get launched until it gains internal traction via dogfooding.

### Ship Fast, Ship Early, Ship Often (Failure)
A cultural principle for product development that embraces failure as a learning mechanism.

How it works: Formerly called 'Ship to learn'. The core idea is that most things will go wrong, but shipping fast allows you to learn and improve quickly, balancing the tension with high quality standards.

### Speed, Quality, Cost Prioritization (Sri Batchu)
You can't optimize all three simultaneously, so choose which phase you're in and sequence them: speed first, then quality, then cost optimization

How it works: Originally from Opendoor (also used at DoorDash). Applied to growth teams: Phase 1 = Build a system that moves fast, Phase 2 = Improve quality, Phase 3 = Optimize cost. Similar to Gibson Biddle's GEM framework (Growth, Engagement, Monetization) — all matter, but pick one to prioritize at a time.

### Tempo Framework (Patrick Campbell)
A system for aligning leadership and teams on execution speed and output expectations.

How it works: 1. Establish mission metric and guiding principles at the top. 2. Determine what 'good' looks like for shipping in each department (e.g., X launches per month). 3. Use leadership meetings to identify the gap between current output and 'good', and solve the blockers.

### The 'Be Embarrassed' Rule (Laura Schaffer)
A cultural rule for product teams to ensure they are shipping fast enough.

How it works: If you are not embarrassed by the first iteration of your release, you have gone too far and spent too much time polishing. Celebrate the unpolished to speed up shipping.

### The Floating Desk (Mayur Kamat)
A prioritization and execution tactic where a leader physically (or virtually) relocates to work directly with the team handling the company's highest-leverage problem.

How it works: Criteria: 1. Identify a problem with a 10x positive or negative impact. 2. Clear your calendar of recurring meetings. 3. Move your desk to sit with the relevant department. 4. Act as the PM/driver for that specific scrum until the problem is solved. 5. Move to the next high-leverage area.

### The Linear Method (Karri Saarinen)
A methodology for building opinionated software and working in consistent cycles to maintain focus.

How it works: Focuses on building opinionated defaults so users don't waste time configuring tools, and using automated 'cycles' (similar to sprints but without the rush) to scope work and ignore the infinite backlog.

### Think it, Build it, Ship it, Tweak it (Gustav Söderström)
A four-phase product development lifecycle used at Spotify.

How it works: 1. Think it (cheap, low investment, risk reduction). 2. Build it (expensive, high investment). 3. Ship it. 4. Tweak it (iterate based on data).

### Timebox Traps (Daniel Lereya)
Setting strict, unmovable external deadlines to force scope reduction and prevent over-engineering.

How it works: Instead of estimating how long a feature will take, the team sets a trap (e.g., 'We have 3 weeks' or 'We will announce this at the next earnings call in 2 months') and builds only the core value that fits that constraint.

### UX Annoyance Sprint Integration (This Week #8: Splitting equity with late-joining co-founders, favorite roadmap templates, and small changes that improve your org)
A framework for systematically addressing UX debt by running a dedicated fix day and then integrating UX improvements into regular sprints

How it works: Process:
1. Compile a list of UX annoyances (distinct from bugs)
2. Set aside a dedicated day where engineers focus on fixing items from the list
3. Move tickets through the full pipeline: Design in Progress → Ready for Dev → In Progress → Code Review → QA → Done
4. Send out a summary email of all improvements made
5. After reflecting with the team, evolve into a sustainable practice: pick 1-2 UX annoyances per sprint and add them to the backlog

Key distinction: 'Painkillers' (bugs/critical fixes managed by PM) vs. 'Vitamins' (UX polish/quality-of-life improvements managed by UX)

### Velocity vs Latency (Startup Speed) (Ravi Mehta)
A mental model distinguishing two types of speed: velocity (quantity of work) and latency (idea-to-learning cycle time), explaining the real startup advantage

How it works: Velocity = quantity of output (big companies always win). Latency = time from idea → test → learning (startups win). Car analogy: fast car has poor turning radius; slow car can turn quickly. Litmus test: How long from deciding to change button text to getting A/B test results? Startup implication: break big plans into small pieces, iterate daily/weekly instead of quarterly.

## Checklists

### Core 4 Getting Started Checklist (Introducing Core 4: The best way to measure and improve your product velocity)
Step-by-step action plan for adopting Core 4 within your organization.

How it works: 1. Share the Core 4 summary slide deck with your leadership team (explains why it was designed and how it can be used)
2. Get a baseline measurement:
   a. Use existing data from workflow tools if you have clean data
   b. Otherwise, use the survey template to collect self-reported metrics
   c. Ensure responses are anonymous
3. Compare your results with industry benchmarks to set high standards and identify gaps
4. Dig into the data to find opportunities for improvement:
   a. Drill down to team-level data
   b. Review qualitative data from engineers
   c. Encourage teams to triage their own results
5. Make hypotheses about what investments will improve metrics
6. Quantify ROI of proposed improvements (in money and/or time frames)
7. Decide what to invest in with product and engineering alignment
8. Execute improvements
9. Re-run survey quarterly to track progress
10. Repeat: locate new areas of intervention, make new hypotheses, iterate

Key question to ask in your next leadership meeting: 'Are your teams moving as fast as they could be, and moving in the same direction?'

### Diagnosing Why Engineers Miss Deadlines (This Week #4: Motivating engineers to hit deadlines, PM career ladders, and aligning with execs)
A 5-step diagnostic checklist to understand the root cause before trying to fix slow delivery

How it works: 1. Ask questions — Talk to engineers and/or eng manager to understand why things take as long as they do. Come with genuine interest, not an agenda. You may discover they can point you to something you can help unblock.
2. Look at other teams — Are your engineers working slower than those on other teams? Talk to other PMs to get a rough benchmark. Consider the overhead of manual QA, code reviews, unit tests, architectural reviews, and launching new services.
3. Do post-mortems — After a project ends (especially when you missed a deadline), run a post-mortem with the team. Focus on learning, not blame. Link to guide: https://backlog.com/blog/run-incredibly-effective-post-mortem-meeting/
4. Re-evaluate how you use deadlines — If deadlines are arbitrary, be upfront about it. Say 'Let's come up with an arbitrary deadline!' Arbitrary deadlines still help coordinate cross-functional deliverables and create some accountability.
5. Alternate between hard and soft deadlines — Be upfront about which type it is. Use soft deadlines to help the team build estimation muscle for when it really counts.

### Product Development Stage Gate Process (P-strat → P0 → P1 → P2) (Varun Parmar)
A four-stage product development process with measured cycle times at each gate, classified by project size (S/M/L), used to benchmark team velocity

How it works: Stages: 1) P-strat: Strategy/insight phase—identify the opportunity and persona need. 2) P0: Problem definition—define the problem to solve with clear metrics. 3) P1: Solution definition—design and ship the solution. 4) P2: Impact measurement—did we hit the metrics defined in P0? Each project classified as Small (< 1 month), Medium, or Large. All cycle times collected and benchmarked across 50+ product teams. Data shows averages, medians, and variance per size category. Teams can self-serve compare their performance and identify bottleneck stages.

### Protect Time for Deep Work (Introducing Core 4: The best way to measure and improve your product velocity)
Success signals and specific actions to ensure developers have sufficient focused, uninterrupted work time.

How it works: Success signals:
- Developers consistently have blocks of focus time that are over an hour long
- Developers have rapid feedback loops to avoid small but frequent disruptions

What to do:
1. Reassess recurring meetings and build a habit of regularly trimming meetings that accumulate over time
2. Prioritize: Plan for engineers to focus on one project or priority at a time ('Never half-ass two things. Whole-ass one thing.')
3. Limit the number of unplanned tasks or requests made to engineers (adjust support rotations or create workflows to avoid one-to-one pings)
4. Adopt no-meeting days or blocks to give developers control over their schedule

### Rapid Shipping Playbook (AI Example) (How Miro builds product)
Key factors that enabled Miro to ship AI beta in 8 weeks, applicable to any urgent initiative

How it works: Key factors for rapid shipping: 1. Flexible roadmap framework that allows reprioritization without being trapped by planning. 2. People with passion around the topic (a motivated team can do a lot). 3. Singular focus - deprioritize everything else for the core team. 4. Fast, almost daily iterations and standups where you tweak things, resolve blockers, and highlight achievements.

### Signs you need to change your development process (Ryan Singer)
A list of pain signals at different stages of the product development lifecycle that indicate the current process isn't working.

How it works: Upstream pains: (1) Requests are vague blobs that never get narrowed down ('build a calendar'). (2) PRDs or Figma files don't result in clarity — more questions keep emerging. (3) Engineers push back on designs because technical reality wasn't considered. Mid-stream pains: (4) Projects keep running over estimated timelines. (5) More and more unexpected complexity surfaces during builds. (6) Team feels like they're getting further from done, not closer. (7) Constant meetings to unblock people who are stuck. Downstream pains: (8) End of sprint/cycle and you can't see the end. (9) Last-minute scope cuts that gut the value. (10) Leadership can't answer 'where are we on this?' (11) Burned-out teams, low morale, loss of excitement.

### Team Velocity Improvement Implementation Checklist (Increasing team velocity)
A step-by-step approach Lenny recommends for using the 15 strategies to improve team velocity

How it works: 1. Review the 15 strategies list with your leadership team
2. Pick 1-2 strategies to focus on
3. Spend the next month or quarter putting them into action
4. Evaluate whether they made a dent in velocity
5. If they worked, continue and reinforce
6. If they didn't work, try a different 1-2 strategies next month/quarter
7. Keep experimenting continuously

### Top 10 Small Changes to Improve Team Effectiveness (This Week #8: Splitting equity with late-joining co-founders, favorite roadmap templates, and small changes that improve your org)
Crowdsourced and ranked list of small organizational changes that made teams meaningfully more effective

How it works: 1. **Track all customer feedback & follow up** — Log every piece of feedback, follow up after shipping improvements (Justin Hales)
2. **Ship analytics with every feature** — Bundle monitoring/analytics with each feature to build a data backlog for justifying budget (Jacob M)
3. **Monday morning photo sharing ('Trip Reports')** — Inspired by 'Trillion Dollar Coach', team shares weekend/vacation photos at start of Monday meeting; 15 min to build human connection (Saffad Khan)
4. **Product Discovery documents** — Introduce structured product discovery docs into engineering-first dev processes (Yehia Khoja)
5. **Monthly rotating social events** — Each team member hosts an activity-based event monthly; shifted introverted team to be more collaborative (Shashin)
6. **Switch to Basecamp** — Replace Google Drive/Docs/Sheets with Basecamp for project management (Monica Banks)
7. **Daily Virtual Scrum on Slack + Product Reviews + Mission/Vision/Strategy docs** — Morning targets, EOD status updates, weekly/bi-weekly product reviews, and written mission/vision/strategy (Vikram)
8. **Business terms glossary deck** — Define MRR, ACV, CAC, CTR, ASO etc. and show to every new joiner (Sudeep Shukla)
9. **Pre-Technical Conception & Legacy Study** — PM studies legacy product, documents functional/technical aspects, provides leads to developers before technical conception; claimed 300% faster development (Chaz)
10. **UX Annoyance Fix Days → Sprint Integration** — Dedicate a day to fix UX annoyances, then integrate 1-2 per sprint as ongoing practice; distinguish 'Painkillers' from 'Vitamins' (Lewis Kang'ethe Ngugi)

## Examples

### Bill.com Competitor Build (Geoff Charles)
A case study of extreme product velocity using a single-threaded team.

How it works: Ramp built a competitor to Bill.com (accounts payable) in 3 months using exactly 3 engineers, 1 designer, and 1 PM. The team was given a single goal, shielded from all other company chaos, and kept secret until they found early traction. The product now moves billions of dollars a year.

### Companies Using Core 4 (Introducing Core 4: The best way to measure and improve your product velocity)
Named companies that have adopted Core 4 and their reported outcomes.

How it works: 1. Vercel - CEO Guillermo Rauch: 'Engineering velocity is everything. Early-stage startups live or die based on product-market fit. With scale-ups, you live or die by velocity.'

2. Intercom - Iain Breen (Head of Developer Experience): Early adopter. 'We've never had as comprehensive of a view before, which was a big win for us. We now have top-level metrics that help us measure and manage our work.'

3. Dropbox - CEO Drew Houston: 'Core 4 marries the state of the art in terms of research with a solution you can deploy in your company, and gives you a much more cohesive picture of what's happening in your organization.'

4. Carta - CTO Will Larson: On PR throughput: 'While this is an extremely hard metric to evaluate in isolation, it's very easy to look at your organization's diffs per engineer against peer companies' diffs per engineer and make an informed judgment about whether things are going well for you.'

Other companies mentioned as users: Meta, Microsoft, Uber (specifically for PR throughput metric).

Total adoption: Hundreds of companies, framework informed by field experience at 300+ companies.

### Core 4 ROI Calculation - 150-Engineer Organization (Introducing Core 4: The best way to measure and improve your product velocity)
A real case study showing how an organization of 150 engineers used Core 4 to justify and measure CI/release workflow investments.

How it works: Organization profile: 150 engineers

Baseline findings:
- Speed and Effectiveness were identified as priority areas for improvement
- Qualitative data: developers reported release processes were hindering velocity
- PR cycle time: ~4 hours
- Time to first review: ~60 minutes
- Flaky tests rated #1 developer priority

ROI estimation method:
1. DXI improvement correlation: 1 point improvement = 13 minutes saved/week/developer = 10 hours/year/developer
   - With 150 engineers, 1 point improvement = 33 hours saved/week
   - Targeting 3-point improvement = ~100 hours/week recovered = ~2 FTE developers

2. PR cycle time reduction: Reducing by 25% would eliminate 1,000+ hours of waiting time/week
   - Calculation: 150 devs × 5.4 PRs × 1.25 hours = 1,000+ hours

Framing options:
- Money frame: 2 FTE weekly salary = $9,600/week = ~$500K annually. 1,000 dev hours waiting = ~$120K/week.
- Time frame: Equivalent capacity of 2+ full-time developers freed up for revenue-generating features

Results after investment:
- Speed, Effectiveness, and Quality all improved
- Impact took a temporary dip (as expected, due to shift from features to infrastructure)
- PR cycle time reduction target was 25%; actual reduction was ~40%
- Speed metric improved to 6.6 PRs per engineer per week
- Exceeded target of saving 1,000 hours of wait time

### Google/Apple 6-Week Sprint Model (Ideal sprint length, designer vs. PM roles, running PM team meetings, running post-mortems, best product/executive coaches, and much more)
Real-world example of how Google Dart and Apple iOS/macOS teams use 6-week development cycles

How it works: Google Dart team:
- Switched from quarterly shipping to 6-week shipping cycles
- Quarterly was too long — easy to drift
- 6 weeks is enough to stay focused and do complex work

Apple iOS/macOS:
- 4 back-to-back sprints, each 8 weeks in size
- 6 weeks of development + 2 weeks of convergence
- During convergence: NO feature work — all testing and fixing work done in the 6 weeks

Modified 8-week cycle structure:
- Weeks 1-2: Engineers get a 'green field' to dig deep, get dirty with details, draw plans
- Weeks 3-6: 'Mad dash' 4 weeks to the finish line
- Weeks 7-8: Testing and convergence only

Rule of thumb: Any feature work estimated at more than 4 weeks needs more grooming before starting.

## Tools

### Kanban Board Structure (Lean from the Trenches) (Ideal sprint length, designer vs. PM roles, running PM team meetings, running post-mortems, best product/executive coaches, and much more)
A Kanban board layout inspired by 'Lean from the Trenches' with an On Deck column fed by four input columns

How it works: Board structure (left to right):
- 4 input columns (feeding into On Deck) — specific column names not fully detailed but represent different work categories/sources
- On Deck — populated with cards from the four columns to the left
- Standard left-to-right flow columns (In Progress, Review, etc.)
- Done

Implementation notes:
- Originally designed for physical wall with post-it notes and painter's tape
- Can be adapted in Jira for remote use (though it requires 'bending' Jira)
- Inspired by the book 'Lean from the Trenches' by Henrik Kniberg (O'Reilly)

Used as a replacement for Scrum with ~20-person engineering teams (3-4 engineers per product team). Results: more alignment, fewer meetings, more flexibility.
