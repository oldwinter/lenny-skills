# Planning Cadence Optimization - Frameworks, Templates & Checklists

*49 artifacts extracted from Lenny's Podcast and Newsletter*

## Frameworks

### 10% Planning Rule (Lane Shackleton)
A heuristic for timeboxing the planning phase of any product cycle.

How it works: Ensure that you are not spending more than 10% of the execution period on planning (e.g., half a day for a one-week sprint).

### 10% Planning Time (Gustav Söderström)
A rule of thumb for balancing planning versus execution in product development.

How it works: Teams should spend no more than 10% of their time planning. For a 10-week quarter, spend 1 week planning. For a 6-month cycle, spend 2 weeks planning.

### 3-Day Strategy Session (Ebi Atawodi)
A schedule for aligning product triads (PM, Design, Eng) on the future roadmap.

How it works: Day 1: Insights (understand work, app teardowns, top 10 problems). Day 2: Strategy (which problems to focus on and in what order). Day 3: Big Rocks (the major initiatives to solve them).

### 4-Phase Product Development Lifecycle (Annie Pearl)
A phased approach to product development used to manage commitments and engineering estimations.

How it works: Phase 1: Discovery (research problem space). Phase 2: Solutioning (user testing, landing on a solution). Phase 3: Build (estimation planning, engineering delivery). Phase 4: Launch, measure, and iterate.

### 75% Weekly Goals (How Perplexity builds product)
A lightweight weekly planning ritual where each team member identifies their top priority and aims to complete 75% of it by end of week, keeping expectations realistic and priorities clear

How it works: Process: 1) Hold a weekly kickoff meeting at the start of each week. 2) Each person sets high-level expectations for their week — just a few bullet points. 3) Everyone identifies their single top priority for the week. 4) Target is to hit 75% of that priority by end of week. 5) This meta-reflection at week start prevents overly reactive or hectic decision-making. Benefits: Brings clarity, keeps priorities visible, and acknowledges that 100% completion is unrealistic in a fast-moving environment.

### 85/15 Bottom-Up vs Top-Down Idea Ratio (How Snowflake builds product)
Snowflake's approach to balancing bottom-up PM-driven ideas with top-down strategic mandates

How it works: Ratio: 85% bottom-up, 15% top-down

Top-down (15%):
- Compliance requirements
- Security mandates
- Company-wide customer promises

Bottom-up (85%):
- PM recognizes customer pain point or opportunity
- PM takes item forward to drive customer impact
- Big boulders serve as the source of many bottom-up ideas

Key metaphor: Big boulders are the 'lighthouse' — they provide perspective and general direction, but there's a lot of judgment and different ways to navigate the actual ship. The ship steering is left to the product manager.

### BTCG Quarterly Priority Roundtable (How Snowflake builds product)
A structured meeting for resolving cross-team priority conflicts, led by Snowflake's most senior product and engineering leaders

How it works: BTCG = Benoit Dageville (co-founder) + Thierry Cruanes (co-founder) + Christian Kleinerman (SVP Product) + Greg Czajkowski (SVP Engineering)

Format:
- Held in the last week of every quarterly planning cycle
- Anyone can add items to the agenda
- Purpose: Ensure alignment on relative priority of investments
- Open, conversational discussion between teams and BTCG
- Resolves priority mismatches
- Works well because teams arrive already roughly aligned on company priorities from big boulders and annual plans

### Collapsed W Planning Process (Vijay)
A planning process where leadership embeds directly in team ideation sessions rather than doing separate top-down/bottom-up review cycles

How it works: Standard W: Strategy memo → teams generate bets → leadership review → teams iterate → finalize. Mixpanel's collapsed W: 1) Leadership writes strategy memo (sets pillars for next year). 2) Teams do 2 weeks of pre-work combining strategy memo with their quantitative/qualitative customer context. 3) Leadership (head of product + head of design) spends 2 weeks embedded with each team in ideation/jam sessions, adding FigJam stickies with ideas. 4) Teams finalize bets with higher confidence and alignment. 5) Roadshow presentation to rest of company for feedback. Works when: team is small enough (10-12 bets total) that leadership can be directly involved.

### Company Architecture (House Metaphor) (Claire Hughes Johnson)
A mental model for the structural components needed to scale a company.

How it works: 1. Foundation: Founding documents (Mission, Long-term goals, Values). 2. Supporting Beams: Operating structures (OKRs, Planning processes). 3. Mechanicals: Operating cadence (QBRs, meeting rhythms, annual events).

### Half-Yearly Planning with Variable Resolution (How Notion builds product)
A planning approach where the company plans for a full half but with different levels of detail for each quarter

How it works: Planning cadence:
- **Twice-yearly planning cycles** produce company-level OKRs (objectives + key results)
- **Near quarter (e.g., Q1)**: List all projects in detail with a prioritized roadmap
- **Far quarter (e.g., Q2)**: Provide high-level bullet points of expected work areas
- **As far quarter begins**: Turn bullet points into concrete plans, incorporating any changes in company strategy
- **Within quarters**: All product teams operate on aligned two-week sprint cycles across the entire org

Sprint variation by team type:
- **Feature teams**: Write down all commitments, assess what got done at sprint end (accountability mechanism)
- **Infrastructure/long-term teams**: Sprints are just a unit of time, not an accountability mechanism

Open question Michael is exploring: Can the product org be more dynamic/continuous rather than stop-the-world planning, while maintaining coordination with GTM and cross-functional teams?

### Inverted W Planning (David Singleton)
A bidirectional planning process to align team goals with company strategy.

How it works: 1. Teams surface immediate thoughts on priorities (bottom-up). 2. Product leaders synthesize into a draft company strategy (top-down). 3. Teams adjust plans based on the strategy (bottom-up). 4. Final synthesis by leadership.

### Linear's Two-Way Product Planning Process (How Linear builds product)
A structured planning approach that combines top-down strategic direction with bottom-up team input, operating at multiple time horizons.

How it works: Process steps:
1. Founders and small leadership group plan strategic direction for the next 12 months
2. In parallel, ask the entire team to share thoughts and ideas via FigJam sessions or surveys
3. Define a high-level roadmap for the next half year based on strategy (e.g., 'focusing on large company needs')
4. Plan in detail for two quarters
5. Sketch out the following half
6. Maintain an extensive backlog to pull from
7. Sequence projects based on 'optimal path' — do X before Y because they support each other, or specific people are needed
8. Pair projects with individual strengths (e.g., advanced front-end projects get strongest front-end engineers)
9. Project plans start as documents/lists of drafted ideas
10. Project team writes the spec
11. Add project to the Roadmap in Linear

No complicated ranking or voting on projects. Relies on leadership and company spending time with customers and using the product regularly to make needs and opportunities apparent.

### Milestone-Based Conservative Forecasting (Sahil Mansuri)
A forecasting approach for uncertain markets: set a conservative annual plan, then define quarterly milestones that trigger predetermined decisions to accelerate or decelerate spending—agreed with the board in advance to avoid optimism bias

How it works: Steps: 1) Set conservative annual target (e.g., plan for 10% revenue decline). 2) Break into quarterly milestones (e.g., Q1 needs $2.5M to stay on track). 3) Define upper threshold that triggers acceleration (unlock additional budget/hiring). 4) Define lower threshold that triggers deceleration (cut spending further). 5) Pre-agree these decisions with board and sales leadership. 6) Execute without debate when milestones are hit or missed. Key principle: Predetermined decisions remove founder optimism bias in the moment.

### Multi-Altitude Planning Cadence (How Figma builds product)
Figma's three-level planning structure: annual company priorities, half-year team roadmaps, and quarterly adjustments.

How it works: Three altitudes of planning: (1) Annual: Leadership team sets high-level company priorities to frame key strategic investments. (2) Half-year (semi-annual): Product teams chart paths to reach those goals, setting their own goals and roadmaps. This is the bigger planning cycle. (3) Quarterly (mid-half): Teams revisit and adjust plans based on learnings and new information. CPO partners with Technical Program Manager on leading the process — TPM designs the process, together they handle comms and implementation.

### Orange and Red Priorities (Hari Srinivasan)
A top-down planning constraint to ensure major company goals are funded before bottom-up planning begins.

How it works: Leadership explicitly defines the 'big rocks' (orange and red priorities) that must get done first. Teams are given these constraints upfront and then do their bottom-up planning around them.

### Planning Cadence Evolution by Company Stage (How Ramp builds product)
How to evolve your planning horizon as your company grows from pre-PMF to multi-product portfolio

How it works: Stage 1 — Pre-Product-Market Fit (sub-20 people): Plan in two-week sprints. Focus on delivering one thing at a time, fast. No backlog. What are we doing today? This week? Don't plan beyond that.

Stage 2 — Product-Market Fit with Core Product (100+ people): Plan in months, one to two quarters at a time. Need deeper coordination with sales, marketing, and customer operations. Shift technology teams toward reusability and durability of systems.

Stage 3 — Multiple Products in a Portfolio (500+ people): Plan on a quarterly basis with bi-annual company OKRs. Reserve the right to toss out the plan the moment it is written. Longer sales cycles and ambitious GTM campaigns need more lead time.

### Ramp's 5-Step Planning Process (How Ramp builds product)
A comprehensive planning framework that replaces traditional OKR-first planning with strategy-first planning, used at the company level

How it works: Step 1: Start with product strategy, bottom-up. Define what you want to achieve and why it leads to outsize outcomes. Align on product vision and top 2-3 company goals, then empower teams closest to the problem to develop their own roadmaps. Co-develop top-level product strategy.

Step 2: Anchor the product strategy with the financial model. Understand how you will monetize, and the tradeoffs between innovation, monetization, and growth. Align with finance on quarterly focus (e.g. increasing operating margins, decreasing credit losses, launching new revenue stream).

Step 3: Publish the product roadmap and align it with the marketing calendar. Share high-level roadmap, get feedback from company leaders, ensure lockstep with large marketing moments. Make explicit what trade-offs you are making to engage in nuanced discussions of X vs. Y.

Step 4: Define company-level OKRs to mobilize cross-functional teams. Timebox OKR planning, stay high-level. Plan bi-annually (not quarterly). Scope to top priorities for the entire company. Limit to a few large cross-functional projects or launches. It should be painful — not everything on the roadmap needs to be in OKRs.

Step 5: OKRs should not be used for performance management. Focus OKRs on things you want to improve vs. just maintain. If you don't hit the goal, that doesn't necessarily mean everyone tied to the goal underperformed.

### Resource Allocation Guidance (60-30-10) (Shreyas Doshi)
A planning-time allocation framework where leaders provide rough percentage targets for different types of work to give teams permission to pursue big opportunities

How it works: Example allocation: 60% on incrementals (features that improve users' lives day-to-day, high ROI), 30% on big new initiatives (one or two major bets), 10% on stability and infrastructure. Inspired by Google's 70-20-10 (70% search/ads, 20% apps like Gmail, 10% big bets). Leader's role: Clarify strategy first, then share allocation guidance, then let teams propose plans within that structure.

### Rolling Roadmap Confidence Framework (How Miro builds product)
A rolling six-month product roadmap with defined confidence levels per quarter

How it works: The product roadmap operates on a rolling six-month cadence: Current quarter = 80% confidence. Subsequent quarter = 50%+ confidence. Previously Miro planned just two weeks out; the longer-term cadence allows more strategic thinking while remaining nimble. The product strategy is revisited mid-year based on progress and emerging market context. The flexible framework allowed Miro to rapidly reprioritize for AI initiatives.

### Rolling Six-Month Roadmap with Confidence Tiers (Varun Parmar)
A roadmap process that balances enterprise customer visibility needs with team agility through decreasing confidence levels over time

How it works: Structure: Rolling 6-month roadmap updated every 3 months. First 3 months: 80% confidence level (80% of claimed items will ship). Next 3 months: 50% confidence level (lower resolution, more flexibility to pivot). Backed by: Annual strategy white paper published internally to all employees, covering key bets, rationale, expected outcomes, and how they ladder to business OKRs. This gives enterprise customers the roadmap visibility they need while explicitly giving product teams permission to pivot in the back half based on customer feedback, competitive moves, or technology breakthroughs.

### Seasons of Planning (Asha Sharma)
A strategic planning framework for highly volatile environments (like AI) that replaces rigid time-based planning with thematic phases.

How it works: 1. Define the 'Season' based on secular changes/customer problems (e.g., 'The rise of agents'). 2. Set a North Star metric. 3. Establish loose quarterly OKRs. 4. Execute in 4-6 week squad goals. 5. Leave slack in the system for the unplanned.

### Shopify's Layered Planning Cadence (How Shopify builds product)
A three-layer planning system that balances strategic direction with tactical flexibility

How it works: Layer 1 - Yearly Themes: CEO sets ~6 themes for the year, written from the merchant's POV (e.g., 'Shopify keeps me on the cutting edge'). Layer 2 - Six-Month Roadmap: Teams translate themes into rough six-month plans aligned with twice-yearly Shopify Editions releases. Teams identify ways to measure impact against themes. High confidence in what ships in the next Edition, some idea of the one after. Layer 3 - Six-Week Sprints: Four six-week cycles per half. Teams do detailed sprint-level planning for current work. Key principle: Don't try to plan more than ~6 months out. Be willing to tear up the plan when the world changes.

### Snowflake's Big Boulders Planning Framework (How Snowflake builds product)
A company-wide alignment framework where leadership identifies 6-10 'big boulders' annually, product areas create six-pager annual plans mapping to boulders, and quarterly planning maps customer scenarios to the same boulders

How it works: Annual cycle:
1. October: Begin annual planning
2. Leadership identifies 6-10 'big boulders' — high-level themes described in 1-2 paragraphs each (e.g., 'Snowflake application development', 'workload and cost optimizations')
3. Each product area creates an annual six-pager plan containing:
   - Overall state of the product
   - Goals
   - Measurable success indicators for the fiscal year
   - Customer scenarios mapped to big boulders
4. Plans reviewed by: area product leader, area engineering leader, area architects, founders, product and engineering VPs
5. Product directors review plans with sales and marketing counterparts to align on sales/marketing plays
6. February: Fiscal year kicks off

Quarterly cycle:
1. Month before each quarter: Outline customer scenarios to focus on
2. Map scenarios back to big boulders
3. Last week of planning cycle: Quarterly planning roundtable (led by BTCG) resolves any competing priorities
4. Anyone can add items to the roundtable agenda

Big boulders serve as a 'lighthouse' — they provide perspective and general direction, but the PM steers the ship

### Sprint Cadence Decision Framework (Ideal sprint length, designer vs. PM roles, running PM team meetings, running post-mortems, best product/executive coaches, and much more)
A decision framework for choosing the right sprint length based on team size, product complexity, and overhead tolerance

How it works: Key decision factors:

1. Team size 2-3 people: Ditch formal sprints entirely, use Kanban or continuous shipping. Focus on maximum throughput.
2. Team size ~20 engineers (3-4 per product team): Kanban works well — fewer meetings, more flexibility, better alignment.
3. Complex feature work (Google-scale): Consider 6-week sprints (the 'goldilocks' number).
   - Modified 8-week cycle: 6 weeks engineering + 2 weeks testing/convergence (no new feature work during convergence)
   - First 2 weeks: Engineers dig deep into details and draw plans
   - Last 4 weeks: 'Mad dash' to finish line
4. Rule of thumb: Any feature work estimated at more than 4 weeks needs more grooming.
5. Key question to ask: 'What does a sprint mean to you?' — Is it for planning? Agile ceremonies? Release cadence?
6. Warning sign: If you're using 1-week sprints, you're likely just adding more meetings as bandaids rather than proper solutions.

Sources referenced: Shape Up by Basecamp (6-week cycles), Google Dart team experience, Apple iOS/macOS development cadence.

### The 'M' Framework for Quarterly Planning (How Gong builds product)
A trimmed-down quarterly planning process shaped like the letter M, typically starting bottom-up from product pods when no new top-down guidance exists

How it works: Process: Starts from product pods (bottom-up) → aggregated into a substantial quarterly plan document (20+ pages) → updates to the annual plan.
Output: Detailed quarterly plan document covering what is expected to be built. Also provides an abridged version of high-level rocks for executive consumption.
Rolling updates: Provides relatively light updates to the annual plan, maintaining a rolling 12-month window with decreasing clarity.
No monthly/biweekly planning: No Scrum sprints. Monthly internal reviews with different groups instead.
Feature tracking: At the beginning of each quarterly cycle, PMs input all planned features into an Airtable tracker that tracks full feature lifecycle.

### The 'W' Framework for Annual Planning (How Gong builds product)
A yearly planning process shaped like the letter W, moving between top-down and bottom-up input in multiple passes to arrive at a detailed annual plan

How it works: Step 1 (Top-down): Management team sets 3-4 top company priorities.
Step 2 (Capacity allocation): Product and engineering determine capacity for different products and product areas based on priorities. Pods may be reallocated (e.g., moving pods to a new product category).
Step 3 (Bottom-up straw-man): Teams build a straw-man plan with 'big rocks' planned for the year. Present to leadership for high-level feedback.
Step 4 (Detailed plan): More detailed plan with specific feature descriptions and concrete timelines.
Output: Guidance for 12 months ahead at decreasing certainty — good certainty for Q1, lower certainty for Q2, very rough sketch for H2.
Communication: Single person in product operations handles collection and communication of plans. Broadly communicated throughout company.
Workshops: Various workshops with sales, customer success, and revenue leadership teams to reduce blind spots.

### The W Framework (The Secret to a Great Planning Process — Lessons from Airbnb and Eventbrite)
A four-step planning framework that structures the back-and-forth between leadership and teams during annual or quarterly planning. Named for the 'W' shape of responsibility passing between leadership and teams across the four steps.

How it works: The W Framework has four steps:

1. **Context** — Leadership shares a high-level strategy with Teams. Leadership sets the vision, priorities, constraints, and key metrics.

2. **Plans** — Teams respond with proposed plans. Each team takes the strategic context and crafts specific plans for how they will contribute.

3. **Integration** — Leadership integrates all team plans into a single cohesive plan and shares it back with Teams. This is where trade-offs are made and conflicts are resolved.

4. **Buy-in** — Teams make final tweaks, confirm buy-in, and get rolling on execution.

The framework solves the root cause of bad planning: lack of clarity on roles (who is responsible for what, when). Key questions it addresses: Who should have a say in the plan and when? What does each stakeholder need to deliver and to whom? Who sets timelines? Who holds everyone accountable? Who makes the final call?

The shape of the W represents responsibility alternating: Leadership → Teams → Leadership → Teams.

### Two-Week Cool Down (Jason Fried)
A scheduled buffer period between intense work cycles to prevent burnout and handle maintenance.

How it works: Occurs after every 6-week cycle. Used for internal freelancing, fixing bugs, tying up loose ends, and shaping/pitching projects for the next cycle.

### Two-Week Crisis Planning Cycles (Sanchan Saxena)
Operating model for when traditional annual/quarterly planning is impossible due to rapidly changing conditions.

How it works: Steps: 1) Abandon annual and quarterly planning, 2) Plan in two-week cycles, 3) Dissolve sub-teams — everyone is one team (#Airbnb), 4) Move resources (engineers, PMs) wherever needed regardless of original team, 5) Combine top-down guidance with bottom-up field intelligence from CX/frontline, 6) Leadership makes decisions every two weeks on most urgent company priorities, 7) Shift from 'feature obsession' and 'revenue obsession' to 'belief obsession' — using first-principles thinking about what will be true when the crisis ends.

### Weekly Business Review (WBR) (Ian McAllister)
A fast-paced, metrics-driven meeting mechanism to review business variances and enforce operational rigor.

How it works: A one-hour meeting covering metrics for the entire business where leaders must be prepared to speak to the variances and trends in their specific key metrics.

## Templates

### "Think Bigger" Charter Section (Eeke de Milliano)
A specific section added to the bottom of team planning charters to encourage innovation.

How it works: Prompt asks: 'With 20% more time, what would you do that isn't on this list already?' or 'If you doubled the team today, what would you do?'

### Bet Template (Planning Artifact) (Vijay)
A Notion database page template used for each product bet during Mixpanel's six-month planning cycle

How it works: Sections: 1) What problem are we solving? 2) What's the evidence of demand? 3) What's the reach and impact of this problem? 4) How do we know we're successful? (Success metrics) 5) What's the key driving hypothesis behind the solution? 6) Rough plan/timeline. Three linked artifacts: Notion bet database, presentation deck (one slide per bet), execution plan (sequencing, staffing, dependencies).

### Bi-weekly Team Highlights Update (Daniel Lereya)
A company-wide update sent every two weeks where every team member writes out their individual highlights and impact.

How it works: Forces individual and team reflection on whether the last two weeks actually drove the intended impact or just activity. Peers read it and evaluate if it was a 'good' or 'bad' two weeks based on impact.

### Figma Roadmap Review Template (How Figma builds product)
A FigJam template used by Figma for their planning process — roadmap reviews that happen as part of their half-year and quarterly planning cycles.

How it works: Available as a FigJam file at https://www.figma.com/file/PQkFgQA77plJMrxMs8PXWt/Roadmap-review-template/duplicate. Used for the primary planning process where product teams chart paths to company goals. Part of Figma's multi-altitude planning: annual company priorities → half-year team roadmaps → quarterly adjustments.

### Planning Timeline Template (My favorite product management templates)
A spreadsheet template for laying out planning cycle milestones and deadlines

How it works: Google Sheets planning timeline template. Linked at: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RTMr9vGCYEhWYA2dKG8EYLDFEtQ1E33W8uDEhmEd8QQ/edit

### Product Planning Brainstorm Template (FigJam) (How Linear builds product)
A FigJam template used by Linear to collect team-wide thoughts and ideas during product planning. Used in parallel with leadership strategy planning to get bottom-up input on areas to improve or tackle.

How it works: Available as a Figma Community file at: https://www.figma.com/community/file/1285828596884760720/product-planning-brainstorm-template. Used during Linear's two-way planning process where leadership defines direction for 12 months while the team shares thoughts via FigJam sessions or surveys.

### Quarterly Capacity Calculator (Timothy Davis)
A tool to track team member capacity against available working days to determine if hiring is needed or if commitments should be cut

How it works: Inputs: Meeting hours, PTO days, travel/offsites (e.g., Shopify bursts), optimization work hours, reporting hours, other commitments. Output: Total required days vs total available days in quarter. If Red (over capacity): 1) First quarter red → observe, may be isolated (summit, extra travel). 2) Second consecutive quarter red → evaluate if meetings can be cut, unnecessary involvement eliminated. 3) Still red after cuts → build business case for new hire specifying what they'd own and how much capacity they'd free up. Only hire if it equates to a full head of work.

### Quarterly Goal-Setting Working Session Agenda (This Week #10: Keeping designers and engineers excited about metrics + Transitioning from DS to PM 🕺)
A structured agenda for running a cross-functional quarterly planning session that gets the whole team aligned on metrics and focus areas

How it works: Phase 1: Review Last Quarter
  1a. Revisit goals and see how we tracked against them
  1b. Revisit major releases or experiments and how they performed according to their success criteria
  1c. Discuss what went well and what didn't (with a focus on goals and what helped or hindered progress towards them)

Phase 2: Review Company Overall Goals
  2a. Look at the company's overall goals
  2b. Review how those goals are being measured and where
  2c. Discuss what teams are involved in each goal and where those teams focus their work

Phase 3: Define Our Next Quarter
  3a. Review team mission and how the team measures success for that mission
  3b. Discuss what levers are at play that help you reach that mission metric (e.g. what parts of your product are involved, what actions users need to take, what indicates you're on the path to your mission metric)
  3c. Define where you should focus to have the biggest impact on your mission metric

Frameworks to help with Phase 3: Growth Loops, HEART framework, North Star framework

### Quarterly Plan Document Structure (How Gong builds product)
The structure of Gong's quarterly planning document that details what will be built in the upcoming quarter

How it works: Full document: 20+ pages detailing the quarterly plan and what is expected to be built.
First page: Overview with quarterly themes/priorities (example shown for FY2024 Q3, covering Oct 2023).
Abridged version: High-level rocks summary for executive consumption — condensed view of major initiatives.
Feature-level tracking: Separate Airtable with all planned features including business rationale, status, links, impact.
Rolling updates: Light updates to the annual plan maintaining a 12-month rolling window.

### Snowflake Annual Product Plan (Six-Pager) (How Snowflake builds product)
The annual plan document structure each product area creates to align with company-level big boulders

How it works: Six-page document that captures:
1. Overall state of the product
2. Goals for the fiscal year
3. Measurable success indicators over the coming fiscal year
4. Customer scenarios related to the big boulders

Review process:
- Reviewed by area product leader, area engineering leader, and area architects
- Snowflake founders + product and engineering VPs also read, review, and add comments
- Product directors then review with sales and marketing counterparts to create joint sales/marketing plays

### Team Calendar Template (Jake Knapp + John Zeratsky)
A shared calendar structure with designated content buckets for specific activities and reserved focus time.

How it works: Block specific times of the week for standing meetings and specific types of collaborative activities, leaving other blocks strictly reserved for solo focus work.

### Weekly Focus Practice (Tim Holley)
Simple weekly ritual for team alignment and accountability, done asynchronously in Slack

How it works: Every Monday in team Slack channel, each person shares: 1) Reflection on last week — did you complete your focus areas? Still in progress? 2) This week's focus — what are you prioritizing (priorities, not tasks)? Benefits: creates social accountability, reveals patterns over time (e.g., which types of work consistently take longer than expected, what recurring items crop up seasonally).

## Checklists

### Annual Product Strategy Planning Process (3 Steps) (How Miro builds product)
Miro's three-step collaborative process for building annual product strategy from the painted picture, run between November and January

How it works: Step 1 - Product Leadership Team identifies priorities: Identify outcomes to achieve for the year. Create initial list of initiatives. Select which past-year initiatives should continue or stop. Add new initiatives. Leaders consult their teams and represent their views. Step 2 - AMPED leaders refine and align: Come together (ideally at in-person offsite, 4-5 days). Refine priorities, discuss conflicts, make tradeoff decisions. Start thinking about staffing needs to ensure important initiatives are appropriately staffed across all functions. Step 3 - Full AMPED org (700+) reviews: Product strategy document is shared with everyone. CPO presents strategy at all-hands meeting. Q&A sessions held where AMPED leaders (not just product leaders) answer questions. Details are refined based on team input. (Miro received and answered 1,000+ questions in their most recent iteration.) After this, each stream identifies which outcomes they will support, what initiatives they will drive, and estimated impact of initiatives. Initiatives go into the rolling product roadmap.

### Planning roles clarity checklist (The Secret to a Great Planning Process — Lessons from Airbnb and Eventbrite)
A set of questions that must be answered before starting any planning process to prevent chaos.

How it works: Before beginning planning, ensure you have clear answers to:
- Who should have a say in the plan, and when?
- What exactly does each stakeholder need to deliver, and to whom?
- Who sets the timelines?
- Who holds everyone accountable?
- Who makes the final call?

## Examples

### Basecamp's origin story as Shape Up's seedling (Ryan Singer)
The founding constraints of Basecamp (DHH working 10 hours/week, Jason's urgency for movement, Ryan doing both UX and code) that naturally produced the Shape Up way of working.

How it works: Constraints: (1) DHH only had 10 hours/week for programming. (2) Jason Fried demanded constant visible movement/progress. (3) Ryan did both UX and coding, eliminating design-engineering walls. (4) No outside investment meant no pressure to grow fast. Result: Intense collaborative sessions (Jason + Ryan) to crack ideas quickly, then hand to David with maximum clarity so nothing was wasted. This organic process was formalized into Shape Up ~10 years later when new hires couldn't reproduce it.

### Stripe Connect Planning in 3 Days (Shreyas Doshi Live)
Case study of how Shreyas reduced annual planning from 4-6 weeks to 3 days for Stripe Connect by having a pre-aligned product strategy

How it works: Stripe Connect was a major product/business for Stripe. Shreyas had put together a real product strategy earlier in the year and gotten alignment from all stakeholders. When planning season came, he completed all planning in 3 days while peers spent 4-6 weeks. He did not fill out unnecessary templates ('bending the rules'). Avoided false precision debates like 8 vs 9 engineers.

## Tools

### Airtable for Sprint Planning (Sri Batchu)
Using Airtable for growth team sprint planning with analytical scoring and metric translation layers built in

How it works: Contains: sprint planning template, scoring methodology, translation layer converting team-level impact metrics into common north star currency. Key feature is that the planning process is analytical enough to need a database/spreadsheet tool rather than a project management tool.

### Recommended Readings on Outcome-Oriented Teams and Planning (This Week #13: Balancing outcome-thinking with design and technical requirements ⚖️)
