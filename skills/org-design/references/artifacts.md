# Organizational Design for Product and Engineering - Frameworks, Templates & Checklists

*102 artifacts extracted from Lenny's Podcast and Newsletter*

## Frameworks

### AAA Framework (Aiming, Assembling, Achieving) (How Shopify builds product)
A framework for clarifying three distinct leadership roles on any project, separating strategy from operations from execution

How it works: Three dimensions of contribution on any project: 1. Aiming: Strategy and direction of what we are building. Sets the vision. May not be the most senior person—could be a staff designer or staff engineer. 2. Assembling: Operational work to bring the right people together and keep them on track. Usually dedicated product ops and program management people. 3. Achieving: The day-to-day work of getting shit done—design, code, etc. The actual builders. Key benefits: Helps identify people's passions (some love aiming, others love assembling). Prevents forcing everyone into one dimension of leadership. Makes it explicit that the team's manager may not be the aimer—by design. Useful for project staffing and role clarity.

### AMPED Organization Model (Varun Parmar)
A cross-functional product org structure that embeds Analytics, Marketing, Product, Engineering, and Design together within each stream/domain, rather than having separate functional silos

How it works: AMPED = Analytics + Marketing + Product + Engineering + Design. Each stream (persona-focused team) includes all five functions embedded together. Product marketing is deeply embedded in each stream to ensure positioning and competitive differentiation are considered from the start. This structure ensures different perspectives (end user, enterprise, competitive) are represented in every product decision.

### AMPED Team Structure (How Miro builds product)
Cross-functional team structure that integrates Analytics, (Product) Marketing, Product, Engineering, and Design into unified product teams organized by streams

How it works: AMPED stands for Analytics, (Product) Marketing, Product, Engineering, and Design. The organization is divided into seven product streams: 1) Core product experience, 2) Enterprise, 3) Growth, 4) Core product foundation, 5) Infrastructure, 6) Platform, 7) Data. Each stream focuses on specific user personas or outcomes. For example: Enterprise stream → enterprise admin and security persona; Platform stream → developer persona; Growth stream → horizontal, focused on acquisition and activation outcomes. Common metrics span across all streams (e.g., improving first-time user experience). Key benefit: brings all required functions together from the start, ensuring diverse perspectives and that positioning/differentiation is considered alongside what to build.

### Barrels and Ammunition (Nick Turley)
An organizational design framework for maximizing team throughput.

How it works: 'Barrels' are empowered people who can make things happen and ship. 'Ammunition' are the people helping them. Maximize barrels to keep teams small but high-throughput.

### Best AEs to CSM Redeployment Strategy (Sahil Mansuri)
Move your highest-performing pre-sales account executives into customer success roles during a downturn to protect the existing revenue base

How it works: Rationale: 1) Cold call/email response rates at all-time lows. 2) Enterprise sales cycles doubled (62 to 115 days). 3) Most deals going to 'no decision.' 4) Replacing churned customers is nearly impossible. 5) Your best talent is typically in pre-sales but there's less for them to close. Action: Reassign best AEs to CSM with mandate 'make sure great customers never leave.' Sahil confirms Bravado is actually doing this—not just advising it. Additional retention tactics: Host in-person customer event (e.g., all-expenses-paid trip in February—creates psychological barrier to churning before the event). Create exclusive customer-only research using your unique cross-customer data.

### Co-Lead Team Structure (How Duolingo builds product)
A cross-functional team leadership model where two or three co-leads (typically PM + Engineering, sometimes with Learning/Curriculum, Biz Ops, or Marketing) jointly run a product team. Each co-lead owns decisions in their domain.

How it works: Structure: Each product team has 2-3 co-leads from different functions. Typical pairings: PM Lead + Engineering Lead (+ optional Learning & Curriculum Lead, Biz Ops Lead, or Marketing Lead). Division of responsibilities: PM co-lead owns product discovery and roadmap decisions. Engineering co-lead owns product delivery and implementation decisions. Benefits: (1) Complementary skills — business acumen + technical expertise together are more effective than one lead from either function. (2) Reduced leadership burden — splitting responsibilities makes it easier to run a high-performing team. Teams are grouped into 'areas' — groups of product teams sharing common business goals. Areas also have cross-functional co-leads. Current areas at Duolingo: Growth (Retention, New User Activation, Reactivation, Connections), Monetization (Subscriptions, In-App Purchases, Ads), Emerging Products (Math, Music), Learning & Curriculum, Platform, and others.

### Company Leadership Type Identifier (Growth Source Rule of Thumb) (This Week #11: What should new PMs over-index on, and empowering product in a sales-driven org)
A rule of thumb for determining what function drives a company based on where the majority of growth comes from, which determines how empowered product teams will be

How it works: Rule of thumb: Wherever the majority of your growth comes from, that's who's driving the ship.

Examples:
- Product-led: Coinbase, Dropbox, Instagram — growth driven by product experience
- Engineering-led: Facebook, Stripe — growth driven by technical capabilities
- Sales-led: Salesforce, most B2B businesses — growth driven by sales teams
- Marketing-led: Casper, Hims, most DTC businesses — growth driven by marketing

Implication for PMs: You'll have the best time and learn the most at a product-led org. At non-product-led orgs, product will always be a second-class citizen. If you're at a sales-driven org with no product empowerment, Lenny's frank advice is to move on rather than try to fix it.

### Company Stage → Org Model Progression (General management, functional, and hybrid models: Which org design works best for top companies?)
A lifecycle-based framework showing how org structure typically evolves as companies grow from early-stage to mature multi-product companies

How it works: Stage 1 - Early stage: Almost always functional model. Founder plays de facto GM role. Team focused on finding product-market fit, scaling core product, building new functionality.

Stage 2 - Scaling/Pre-IPO: Consider GM model when you have: (a) multiple proven product groups, (b) predictable business outcomes, (c) significant scale (hundreds of millions+ in revenue, thousands of employees). Examples: Block transitioned near IPO; Coinbase shifted in late 2022 with multi-billions in revenue; Airbnb restructured ~10 years after founding.

Stage 3 - Mature: Most companies operate in hybrid but skew toward one model. Companies may swing back — e.g., Airbnb reverted to functional after divesting new business bets during the pandemic; Block moved from GM back to functional.

Key insight: Companies often start functional → swing to GM for additional growth → may swing back to functional or settle into hybrid.

### Conway's Law (Dhanji R. Prasanna)
The principle that organizations design systems that mirror their own communication structures.

How it works: Used to explain why moving from siloed GM structures to a unified functional structure was necessary to align technical strategy and build cohesive platforms.

### Customer-Oriented Team Structure (Sachin Monga)
Organizing product teams around customer types (writers, readers, growth) rather than product surfaces (app, dashboard, podcasting) to create more durable team structures

How it works: Three teams: (1) Writer team — serves writers, (2) Reader team — serves readers, (3) Growth team — does growth work. Plus a systems/infrastructure team without a PM. Each team has a PM, engineering manager, data person or designer, and engineers. Principle: orient around customers and timeless missions, not ephemeral product surfaces.

### Decentralized Decision-Making with Post-Hoc Alignment (How Perplexity builds product)
A product decision-making approach where individuals make urgent, locally optimal decisions and misalignments are ironed out afterward rather than seeking consensus upfront

How it works: Principles: 1) Take user and internal feedback and distill it into a few intuitive products that serve many customers. 2) Set a broad vision but let individuals control their own decisions about what would best serve the original goal. 3) Pass the torch of responsibility to individuals — no approval processes needed. 4) Individuals make urgent, locally optimal decisions. 5) Any misalignments are ironed out quickly afterward. 6) When teams don't have a PM, team members take on PM responsibilities: adjusting scope, making user-facing decisions, and trusting their own taste. 7) All teams share common top-level metrics while A/B testing within their layer of the stack. 8) Avoid binding anyone's identity to a specific component of the product (prevents political issues when product shifts quickly).

### Downstream Impact Assessment for Org Design (General management, functional, and hybrid models: Which org design works best for top companies?)
Two additional factors to evaluate when choosing between GM, functional, or hybrid models, focused on teams and talent

How it works: Factor A: Can the business support redundant teams?
- GM model: Often requires redundant staffing across functions (compliance, communications, marketing, etc.) so business units operate independently. Example: Square and Cash App had mirrored corporate structures and even separate offices.
- Hybrid: Centralized platform teams + GM business units. Platform groups build shared services (AI, identity, security). GM units build products unique to customer segments. Examples: Coinbase (3 BUs: institutions, consumers, developers), Intuit (B2B: QuickBooks/Mailchimp; Consumer: TurboTax/Credit Karma).
- Functional with GM-like champions: Companies like Meta and Shopify use task forces with champions/captains for company-level priorities who act as quasi-GMs. Use decision frameworks (RACI, RAPID, SPADE) to delegate.

Factor B: What type of talent is the company aiming to retain?
- GM model: Requires leaders with deep domain expertise in specific business areas. Career ladder bottleneck: limited GM positions; ambitious leaders may leave.
- Functional model: Requires strong, flexible crafters (EPD triad is fungible across projects). Career ladder: discipline leaders grow scope of impact, but few get end-to-end business ownership.
- Hybrid model: Offers most flexibility — champions lead cross-discipline priorities (GM-like), horizontal product groups (platform, growth) span business units, providing breadth opportunities for senior leaders.

### Duolingo Product Org Reporting Structure (How Duolingo builds product)
The reporting structure for product management, design, engineering, and related functions at Duolingo

How it works: VP of Product (Cem Kansu) → reports to CEO (Luis von Ahn). Under VP of Product: All of Product Management, Product Ops, UX Research. VP of Design (Simmy) → All of Design reports here. CTO (Severin) and Chief Engineering Officer (Natalie) → All of Engineering reports to one of them → both report to CEO. Team level: PM on Retention team → reports to PM Area Lead for Growth → reports to VP of Product. Engineering on Retention team → reports to Engineering Area Lead for Growth → reports to CTO/CEO. Team co-leads (PM + Eng) jointly responsible for team success and roadmap. Area co-leads (PM + Eng + possibly Marketing/other) responsible for area-level goals.

### EM/PM Shared Performance Rating (Will Larson)
Aligning EM and PM incentives by giving paired engineering managers and product managers the same performance review rating, with the CPO and CTO calibrating together.

How it works: Approach: EM/PM pairs generally receive the same performance rating. CPO and CTO calibrate together. Exceptions exist for clear individual non-performance. Teams are told this is happening so they understand shared accountability. Can extend to trifectas (EM + PM + business lead). Carta's CEO Henry Ward has a blog post about trifectas. Result: Forces both parties to solve for the full set of constraints, not just their functional constraints.

### End-to-End Ownership Model for PM-EM Pairs (How Notion builds product)
A philosophy for PM and EM collaboration where both jointly own product and business outcomes, contrasted with siloed models at other companies

How it works: Three models contrasted:

**Microsoft model (waterfall)**: PMs go into mountains twice a year, come down with stone tablets, hand to engineering for execution. Very waterfall.

**Facebook model (split accountability)**: Build the wrong thing → Zuck yells at PM. Thing built badly → Zuck yells at EM. Spheres of accountability are somewhat disjointed.

**Notion model (joint ownership)**: EMs and PMs have joint responsibility for EVERYTHING. Both should:
- Stare at the team together
- Figure out what's needed to achieve outcomes
- Be willing to do whatever is necessary
- Not be rigid about role definition

Practical examples of boundary-crossing:
- PM has 1:1s with engineers weekly if needed
- EM works directly with Customer Success if needed
- PM won't review full tech spec details (acknowledged boundary)
- EM won't work on launch video details with PMM (acknowledged boundary)
- But together they own product AND business outcomes

Ideal state: EM and PM are 'joined at the hip' or 'mind-melded'

### Fast and Slow Thinking Org Structure (Howie Liu)
An organizational model that splits product/engineering into two distinct groups based on execution speed.

How it works: Fast Thinking Group: Ships jaw-dropping AI capabilities weekly, operates with high autonomy. Slow Thinking Group: Deliberate, premeditated execution for complex infrastructure (e.g., multi-hundred million record databases).

### Feature Teams vs. Empowered Teams Spectrum (In defense of feature team product managers)
A framework for distinguishing between feature teams (rewarding outputs over outcomes) and empowered teams (rewarding outcomes over outputs), including the specific responsibilities that differ between the two models

How it works: Feature Team PM Activities (shared with empowered teams):
1. PM writes a PRD/project brief that outlines goals, constraints, requirements, etc.
2. PM partners with design to figure out where the new feature will live in the product, map out the total surface area of the feature, flesh out the general UX
3. PM partners with engineering lead to discuss any architectural changes required to support the new feature
4. PM works with research (or drives research themselves) to line up customer discovery conversations with customers expected to benefit from the feature
5. PM equips sales and marketing with key information about new capabilities being developed
6. PM measures the post-launch adoption and performance of new features
7. PM socializes the initiative internally to get people excited about it

Empowered Team PM Additional Responsibilities:
- Pre-execution: PMs drive opportunity identification, problem prioritization, and right-sizing the solution scope to the chosen problem
- Post-launch: PMs iterate on the solution until the customer problem is solved and business impact realized

Key distinction: Feature teams are praised for shipping many features. Empowered teams are praised for helping the company figure out WHAT to build, solving customer problems, improving customer satisfaction, moving key product metrics, and contributing to company goals.

### Five-Legged Stool Team Model (Tim Holley)
Etsy's cross-functional team structure with five equal leadership roles: Product, Engineering, Design, Insights (research + analytics), and Marketing

How it works: Five legs: 1) Product Manager, 2) Engineering, 3) Design, 4) Insights (research + analytics partners), 5) Marketing (product marketing or brand marketing depending on context). PM is accountable for decisions when consensus isn't clear, but does not operate as mini-CEO. Not every team has all five dedicated — some have coverage rather than dedicated roles.

### Flying Formation (DACI) (Melissa Tan)
A framework and document structure for defining cross-functional roles, metric ownership, and operating rhythms between growth, marketing, and product teams.

How it works: DACI stands for Driver, Accountable (final decision maker), Contributor, Informed. The document includes: specific metric ownership (e.g., marketing = signups/CAC, product growth = downstream ARR), weekly meeting cadences for metric review, and quarterly planning processes.

### Founder-to-PM Responsibility Delegation Sequence (When they hired their first PM)
The natural progression of who handles PM duties as a startup grows

How it works: Stage 1: Founder takes on all PM duties
Stage 2: Duties divided among early engineers and designers
Stage 3: Full-time product manager is hired

Key principle: Let your first PM own execution while founders retain strategy and vision.
- PM owns: Execution, triaging issues, weekly rhythm, prioritization of incoming requests, identifying product decisions, shipping
- Founders retain: Vision, strategic direction, high-level decision-making, approval on major decisions
- Shared: Customer insights, roadmap input

Clarify explicitly: How is roadmap now decided? Where are co-founder and PM responsibilities shared vs. delineated?

### Functions and Missions Organizational Matrix (Alex Hardimen)
A two-axis organizational structure for scaling cross-functional product teams.

How it works: Axis 1: Functions (Product, Design) focused on standards, craft, and career growth. Axis 2: Missions (Consumer, Monetization, Platform) which are cross-functional teams led by a GM/Product/Eng leader pursuing shared goals. Consumer missions uniquely embed domain experts (editors).

### GM vs. Functional Model Comparison Matrix (General management, functional, and hybrid models: Which org design works best for top companies?)
A comprehensive comparison of the three org models across multiple dimensions synthesized from the full newsletter

How it works: GM Model:
- P&L ownership: Yes, each GM owns business outcomes
- Decision speed: Fast, autonomous business units
- Product cohesion: Lower, risk of fragmented customer journeys
- Team structure: Redundant functional teams across BUs
- Talent type: Deep domain experts
- Career path: Limited GM slots; bottleneck at top
- Best for: Multi-product companies with revenue-proximate metrics, distinct customer segments
- Examples: Block (pre-2023), Coinbase, early Airbnb expansion

Functional Model:
- P&L ownership: No, discipline leaders co-lead product metrics
- Decision speed: Slower, requires cross-functional alignment
- Product cohesion: High, seamless customer journeys
- Team structure: Centralized, efficient, no redundancy
- Talent type: Strong, flexible crafters; fungible EPD triad
- Career path: Growing scope within discipline, but limited end-to-end business ownership
- Best for: Growth-stage companies, engagement-driven metrics, products where holistic journey matters
- Examples: Block (post-2023), Shopify (post-2020), Meta, Google Search, Airbnb (current)

Hybrid Model:
- P&L ownership: Partial — some units have P&L, some have product metrics
- Decision speed: Moderate — GM speed where needed, functional cohesion elsewhere
- Product cohesion: Moderate — depends on structure
- Team structure: Centralized platform + dedicated BU teams
- Talent type: Mix of domain experts and flexible crafters
- Career path: Most flexible — champions, horizontal groups, GM-like roles within functional structures
- Best for: Companies where both product and operational metrics matter, complex go-to-market
- Examples: DoorDash, Canva, Coinbase, Intuit, Meta (with champions), Shopify (with champions)

### GM vs. Functional vs. Hybrid Org Model Decision Framework (General management, functional, and hybrid models: Which org design works best for top companies?)
A two-factor framework for deciding which organizational model suits a company, based on (A) proximity of North Star metric to revenue and (B) importance of holistic customer journey to growth

How it works: Factor A: How close is the product North Star metric to revenue?
- Close to revenue (e.g., transaction volume → topline revenue): GM model is better suited. Examples: Block, Coinbase, Amazon.
- Removed from revenue (e.g., user growth/engagement → ad impressions → revenue): Functional model is better. Examples: Meta, Google Search.
- In between (both product and operational metrics equally important): Hybrid model. Examples: DoorDash (product leaders + GMs), Canva (product teams + GMs for content).

Factor B: How critical is the holistic customer journey to the product's growth?
- Highly critical (seamless journey enables organic flywheels): Functional model. Example: Shopify's back-office suite.
- Less critical (distinct business units serve different segments independently): GM model. Example: Intuit's B2B vs. consumer segments.
- Mixed: Hybrid model.

### Headcount Growth Limits (Molly Graham)
A rule of thumb for safe company scaling speeds.

How it works: 50% annual headcount growth is happy. 100% is manageable. >100% is a bad idea because the company moves too fast to de-dupe roles and issues, leading to chaos.

### Interconnected Product Coordination Model (How Notion builds product)
An approach to product coordination when no part of the product can be isolated, contrasted with independent product line models

How it works: Two models contrasted:

**Independent Product Lines (e.g., Stripe)**:
- Products linked only by competencies needed to build them (e.g., ML/AI)
- Example: Radar (fraud) and Capital (lending) — changes to one don't affect the other
- Teams can operate independently with minimal coordination

**Interconnected Product (e.g., Notion)**:
- You can't decompose the product into individual independent products
- Example: Changing how databases work affects project management, docs, AND wiki use cases
- Requires more central planning and product coordination
- Must ensure changes are considered holistically
- Must prevent teams from stepping over each other in ways that worsen the product

Implication: Interconnected products need fewer, more senior PMs who coordinate across teams, rather than many independent PMs owning isolated areas.

### Leadership Triad Model (14 habits of highly effective product managers)
The PM-EM-DM (Product Manager, Engineering Manager, Design Manager) leadership structure that great PMs build and maintain

How it works: The three leaders of a product team—PM, Engineering Manager, and Design Manager—should function as a tight, aligned unit that speaks with one voice. Building this triad involves: (1) Physical proximity — sit near each other when possible; (2) Structural alignment — weekly meeting to align on priorities, share information, and unblock the team; (3) Personal connection — spend time outside work to connect as humans. This is essential because most of the team reports to the EM and DM, so alignment among these three directly impacts team effectiveness.

### Linear's No-PM Project Team Model (How Linear builds product)
A framework for running product teams without traditional PMs, where the project team serves as its own PM.

How it works: Structure:
- One Head of Product for the entire company (~50 people)
- No PMs assigned to teams or projects
- Each project has a Project Lead (engineer or designer, never a PM)
- Project Lead's role: get the project started and communicate how it's going
- Typical project team: 1 designer + 2 engineers
- ~6 project teams run in parallel
- Teams disperse after project completion and reform for next project
- One founder or Head of Product sponsors each project, sitting in meetings and providing feedback/direction
- Engineers and designers handle user communication, stakeholder management, and product decisions

Benefits:
- Higher quality through ownership
- Ideas emerge during building (e.g., engineer independently improving context menu hover behavior)
- Avoids 'feature factory' mentality
- Generally get projects done right the first time

Downsides:
- Engineers/designers spend time on non-core tasks (communicating, user research)
- Can feel like it slows things down
- Harder to hire — many candidates lack experience working this way

### Long-Term Governance Structures (Eric Ries)
Legal mechanisms to protect a company's mission from short-term shareholder pressure.

How it works: Includes the 'Board Mission Pledge' (requiring board members to use business judgment to support the mission, not just shareholders) and the 'LTSPV' (Long-Term Special Purpose Vehicle, where LPs sign contracts pre-committing to support the company's mission in future conflicts).

### Metric-Based Team Structure (Soft Ownership) (Jackson Shuttleworth)
An organizational model where teams own metrics rather than specific product surfaces.

How it works: Teams are assigned a North Star metric (e.g., CURR - Current User Retention Rate). The team can work on any feature that drives that metric. Other teams can also modify those same features if it serves their distinct metrics (e.g., learning time), provided they coordinate on roadmaps.

### Metric-Based vs. Feature-Based Team Classification (How Duolingo builds product)
A framework for deciding whether to structure product teams around quantitative metrics or around product missions/problems

How it works: Metric-Based Teams: Structured around clear metrics that impact company goals. Examples: In-App Purchases team → owns IAP revenue metric (part of Monetization area which owns total app revenue = IAP + ads + subscription). Retention team → owns current user retention rate (CURR) (part of Growth area which owns DAUs). Feature-Based Teams: Defined by product problem to solve; no single metric accurately quantifies success. Examples: Connections team → mission is 'making Duolingo more social' (part of Growth area). Path team → mission is 'create a path for learners that maximizes learning efficacy and makes Duolingo engaging'. How to measure success for feature-based teams (4 signals): (1) Internal usage and buzz — do employees use and talk about the features? (2) User research studies on features being built. (3) Public forum signals — Reddit, Twitter reactions. (4) Long-term holdout experiments — launch to majority, hold small % in control for 3+ months to measure long-term effects.

### Notion's Four-Layer Product Team Structure (How Notion builds product)
A metaphorical layered team structure for highly interconnected products where no feature can be fully isolated

How it works: Four layers (metaphorical, not exact org structure):

**Layer 1 - Use-Case/Workflow Teams** (top layer):
- Own user-facing use cases, stories, or workflows
- Examples: Project Management team, Docs & Wiki team
- Solve user problems through: leveraging existing primitives, extending them as needed, developing custom functionality

**Layer 2 - Primitive Teams**:
- Own underlying reusable building blocks
- Example: Databases team (called 'Collections' internally)
- Serve multiple use-case teams as 'clients' (e.g., both wiki and project management teams depend on databases)

**Layer 3 - Notion-wide Systems**:
- Own cross-cutting systems: search, notifications, sidebar, etc.
- Has a PM lead overseeing all systems

**Layer 4 - Infrastructure** (bottom layer):
- Foundational technical infrastructure

**Cross-cutting roles**: Some PMs (e.g., Enterprise PM) work across all layers, advocating for segment-specific needs (e.g., data residency, verification of pages, API/integrations) rather than mapping to a single team.

### Org Design Principles for Product Velocity (How Ramp builds product)
Three principles for structuring the product organization to maximize speed and collaboration

How it works: 1. PM, Design, Engineering, and Data should be equal parts of the same team. If design reports into Product, the UX suffers. Design needs its own agenda and discovery — that's where truly brilliant ideas come from.

2. Everyone should report to the same tech-minded leader. All heads report into the CTO. If Product reports to CEO and Engineering to CTO, the only escalation path is CEO-CTO — too high up. You risk Product becoming 'stakeholders' to Engineering instead of 'co-founders.'

3. Design your org the way you want your product to perform. You ship your org structure. Think about core competencies you want to amplify. If Data is not an equal, you are not elevating data-driven decision-making, data-science-driven products, and objective accountability.

### Org Design as a Product (What Seven Years at Airbnb Taught Me About Building a Business)
Three principles for treating organizational structure as a product to be designed and iterated on.

How it works: Three principles: 1) Optimize for dedicated cross-functional teams with a clear mandate — self-contained teams that move autonomously toward an agreed-upon goal. Any missing resource (designer, data scientist, budget), additional cross-team dependency, or conflicting surface area cuts impact immensely (often invisibly). Minimize times a team needs to meet with or wait for another team. Well-functioning teams feel like a 'black box that outputs regular updates and amazing work.' 2) Get the goals right — limited to 1-2, quick feedback loops, connected to top-line growth, easily understood, uncomfortable. 3) Accept there is no perfect org design — Lenny went through ~12 reorgs at Airbnb. Address the biggest pain points, future-proof as much as possible, note the flaws (overlapping ownership, shared metrics, overloaded teams), put systems in place to work around them, and set expectations the org will change again.

### PM Function Evolution Timeline (When to hire your first product manager)
The typical progression of how the PM function evolves at most companies

How it works: Stage progression: Founders do PM work → Other team members take on PM responsibilities → First full-time PM is hired → PM team grows. At each stage, the three PM jobs (Shape, Ship, Synchronize) must be covered. The key evaluation at each stage: Are the people doing PM work good at these jobs, and do they want to do these jobs? If not, it's time to hire a dedicated PM.

### PM Headcount Restriction Philosophy (How Ramp builds product)
Philosophy and benefits of deliberately keeping PM headcount low to maximize leverage (impact divided by headcount)

How it works: Restrict PM hiring until it's patently obvious to everyone that product is the bottleneck to velocity. Benefits:

1. It makes everyone at the company do some type of PM job — builds culture of caring about business goals, customer pain points, and shipping.

2. It makes every PM have a larger scope — eliminates time-consuming fights for resources and politics. They have too much to do to ask for more.

3. It makes the team welcome that PM when they join, and gives them clear value to deliver for a win.

Ramp had fewer than 5 PMs and fewer than 50 engineers when they scaled to $100M in ARR. At the time of writing, they have 14 PMs.

### Paired Problem Team Organization (Vijay)
Organizing product teams around pairs of problems that have inherent tension, forcing a single team to own and beat the trade-off

How it works: Mixpanel's problem pairs: Power + Simplicity (core analysis team), Data Trust, Onboarding, Collaboration, Price Performance. Key insight: Problems with tension between them (e.g., power vs. simplicity) should be owned by the same team so they're forced to confront and beat the trade-off, rather than separate teams optimizing for one dimension.

### Player-Coach Org Design (Grant Lee)
An organizational structure where there are no pure managers; all people leaders also do individual contributor (IC) work.

How it works: Managers stay close to the work so they can adjust priorities on the fly (like a quarterback reading a defense on the field) rather than just calling plays from the sideline.

### Pod-Based Team Structure (How Gong builds product)
Autonomous multi-skill team (pod) structure organized around problem areas and jobs-to-be-done rather than engineering specializations

How it works: Pod composition: 1 Product Manager + 1 Product Designer + handful of engineers (front-end, back-end, generalists).
Pod focus: Each pod focuses on a 'problem area' (e.g., 'sales forecasting') aligned with jobs carried out by a persona (e.g., sales coach) or by multiple people doing a business process (e.g., pipeline review).
Groups: Pods assembled into 'groups,' each roughly aligned with a product/category (e.g., 'conversation intelligence,' 'sales engagement').
Products span multiple user types across connected workflows.
Exceptions: Data platform group (centralized — handles data capture, export, integrations spanning multiple products). User journey group (cross-product — home page, targeting, recommendations, mobile app).
Non-build functions under CPO: go-to-market for new products, field product management, product partnerships, product marketing.
Scale: 24 PMs organized into 6 groups.

### Product Operating Model (Melissa Perri)
A holistic way to structure a product organization beyond just development processes.

How it works: Consists of four main pillars: 1) Product Strategy (tying work back to business goals), 2) Organizational Design (structuring teams and career paths), 3) Product Operations (infrastructure and data to make decisions), and 4) Culture and Incentives (rewarding value creation over output).

### Product Stack Organization Model (Tim Holley)
Etsy's product org structure organized into four layers based on proximity to customer and function

How it works: Four layers: 1) Core Customer Teams — buyer and seller facing, on the front lines; 2) Partner Teams — work with end customers but have external constraints (e.g., payments working with card networks); 3) Enablement Teams — serve other teams through recommender systems, design systems, etc.; 4) Infrastructure — foundational technical teams. Org design follows strategy and should evolve as strategy evolves.

### Project Manager vs Product Manager vs Program Manager Role Definitions (This Week #2: Tackling the chicken-and-egg problem, building a growth team from scratch, and addressing overlap with PM peers 🤔)
A framework for distinguishing between three commonly confused PM roles, useful for defining responsibilities and resolving overlap

How it works: **Project Manager**: Responsible for *project* success. Ensures everyone is aligned around the same deadlines, the right people are talking when they need to be, and the project launches on time. Success = projects launch on time and under budget. Projects are one-off and come to an end.

**Product Manager**: Responsible for *product* success. Examples of products: the Substack website, the Google Maps mobile app, the Slack onboarding flow. Success = products drive business impact. Often encompasses project management responsibilities and includes a direct relationship with engineers, designers, researchers.

**Program Manager**: Responsible for *program* success. Examples of programs: Bird scooter charging program, Airbnb Superhost program, Lyft ambassador program. Key distinction from product manager: whether the core of the work is *building* a product (working with engineers, designers, researchers) vs. *using existing products* (working with ops, sales, marketing). Key distinction from project manager: a program is made up of multiple projects and requires longer-term thinking.

### Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) (Melissa Perri)
A highly structured, prescriptive framework for scaling agile across large enterprises.

How it works: Uses 'Release Trains' to group teams, 'Big Room Planning' for quarterly commitments, and explicitly splits the PM and PO roles (PM does discovery/strategy, PO sits with developers and writes user stories).

### Separate C-Corp Innovation Model (Matt Mochary)
A structural approach to building new products inside a large company without being slowed down by core processes.

How it works: Hire former YC founders whose startups failed. Create a completely separate C-corp with a new brand name. Bypass EPD (Engineering, Product, Design) approval entirely. Report directly to the CEO.

### Silos vs. No-Silos Debate for Community-Based Products (Lessons on building a viral consumer app: The story of Saturn)
Two competing schools of thought on whether to build community-specific (siloed) experiences when scaling a consumer product

How it works: School of Thought 1 - Avoid Silos: Silos will naturally inhibit scale. Building community-specific experiences creates operational overhead and limits growth velocity.

School of Thought 2 - Embrace Silos (Saturn's approach): Silos enable better product-market fit by solving for users who are very similar. Over time, this helps you build a product that remains high-fit across the country.

Saturn chose School 2, resulting in bespoke support for nearly 20,000 schools. They chose to 'scale this personalized product approach, instead of changing the product to make it less personal.'

Tradeoffs of the silo approach:
- Requires patience
- Requires willingness to invest heavily in building unique tools and infrastructure
- Requires hiring more people
- May require more capital to support
- Not every founder can or should choose this path

Historical precedent: Facebook went to significant lengths to support their early schools well, which was fundamental to achieving significant depth in each school. This got the network off the ground and eventually allowed them to expand to a broader product.

### Single-Threaded Leader Model (Bill Carr)
An organizational structure where a single leader and their dedicated, cross-functional team focus entirely on one program or problem.

How it works: Requires moving from project to program orientation, establishing service-based architecture (APIs), and implementing functional countermeasures to maintain craft excellence.

### Six Principles for Organizing Product Teams (How Ramp builds product)
How to structure product pods for maximum velocity and accountability

How it works: 1. Teams are organized based on customer or business outcomes above all else. Give big mandates with tight timelines. E.g. 'drive 50% of SQLs by automating outbound emails' or 'build a competitor to Bill.com in three months.' Key: tech teams must deeply understand how the business functions.

2. Teams publish openly clear contracts with each other (goal, strategy, roadmap, metrics, user flows, underlying systems, stakeholders).

3. Make staffing flexible, regardless of reporting lines. Folks jump to different teams based on business needs. Management is about hiring, staffing, coaching, development. Use Tech Leads in scrum teams who don't manage but drive strategy and execution.

4. Embed platform teams as long as possible. Pure platform teams are too far removed from business context. E.g. payments platform embedded in Bill Pay product; data-science platform embedded in risk team. Spin out after a few wins.

5. Keep teams small — no more than 5 to 10 engineers per team.

6. Map the rest of the org to your tech teams. Each product 'pod' gets a dedicated Product Marketer, Product Operator, Product Partnerships Lead, and Product Counsel.

### Slime Mold Organization Model (How Perplexity builds product)
A framework for structuring teams to minimize coordination headwind, inspired by Alex Komoroske's deck on seeing organizations as slime mold. The core idea is that coordination costs (from uncertainty and disagreements) increase with scale, and adding managers doesn't help because incentives misalign and communication gets distorted through layers.

How it works: Key principles: 1) Keep overall goals aligned across the org. 2) Parallelize projects that point toward shared goals. 3) Share reusable guides and processes instead of adding managers. 4) Use AI for 'rubber duck debugging' ideas instead of seeking perfect alignment/consensus. 5) Maintain a 'who's who' list so anyone can reach out to anyone directly. 6) Before asking a colleague a question, first spend one minute asking AI to reduce coordination costs. 7) Trust individuals to make locally optimal decisions and iron out misalignments afterward. Source deck: komoroske.com/slime-mold/

### Startup Title Framework (Gokul Rajaram)
A naming convention for early-stage startup roles to avoid title inflation.

How it works: Avoid 'Director' and 'VP'. Use '[Function] Lead' or 'Head of [Function]'. Add more words to make the role more specific (e.g., 'Caviar Strategy and Operations Lead').

### The Chief Engineer (Eric Ries)
A product leadership structure borrowed from Toyota.

How it works: A single person with moral authority over an entire product line from start to finish. They have no direct reports, but they make all the critical trade-off decisions (e.g., cost vs. aerodynamics vs. materials) to ensure a coherent design vision.

### The Double Triangle Model (Nan Yu)
An organizational mental model for the Product Management function.

How it works: Places the Product Manager in the center, bridging the 'building' triad (Engineering, Product, Design) and the 'selling' triad (Sales, Marketing, Product Management). PMs act as the connector between commercial goals and technical possibilities.

### The Heat Metaphor — Where to Focus as a Company Scales (Raaz Herzberg)
A model for identifying where the critical bottleneck sits in a growing company, and where to deploy the best people. The 'heat' moves through the organization as it scales.

How it works: Stage 1 — Product: Heat is in the product kitchen. Everyone is waiting to have something to show. Stage 2 — Engineering: Heat moves to engineering. 'Someone wants it, build it, make it work.' Stage 3 — Sales: Heat moves to sales. 'We have this thing, now go sell it.' First couple million in deals done by founders. Stage 4 — Marketing: Heat moves to marketing. 'Salespeople can sell it, but they need more pipeline. Nobody has heard of us.' Key principle: Follow the heat and put your best people where the bottleneck is.

### The Loop, Not the Lane (Asha Sharma)
An organizational mindset for product teams emphasizing cross-functional, continuous iteration over siloed, step-by-step handoffs.

How it works: Dissolves traditional functional lanes (PM, Eng, Design). Requires 'full stack builders' obsessed with the continuous loop of efficiency, cost, reward systems, and UI/UX. Feedback becomes continuous and observability becomes the culture.

### The Rule of Eights (Jason M Lemkin)
An organizational design heuristic for scaling a sales team.

How it works: 8 SDRs (outbound reps) report to 1 Manager. 8 AEs (account executives) report to 1 Director. 8 Directors report to 1 VP.

### The Small Bus Metaphor (Ivan Zhao)
A mental model for keeping a company lean, emphasizing agility and talent density.

How it works: A smaller vehicle can turn corners and accelerate faster than a large boat or bus. As a leader, you carefully choose your 'seatmates' to dictate the speed and experience of the company.

### Thermal Team Structure (Keith Coleman & Jay Baxter)
A framework for setting up highly autonomous, fast-moving internal startup teams.

How it works: 1. One clear driver (founder) of the project. 2. One clear senior decision-maker outside the team (e.g., CEO). 3. 100% focus from all team members (no split attention). 4. No standard OKRs or corporate planning cycles; set goals based on the next immediate milestone. 5. Team members must self-select/opt-in to join.

### Three-Pillar Product Owner Specialization (Dmitry Zlokazov)
A model for categorizing product managers based on their spike while maintaining a shared core skill set.

How it works: Divides POs into UX (consumer-facing, high taste), Technical (former engineers, deep system details), and Data Science (former data scientists). 85-90% of the role is shared: linear/nonlinear problem solving, customer empathy, deep detail orientation, and business acumen.

### Tripartite Open Source Governance Structure (Matt Mullenweg)
A structural model for managing a massive open-source project balancing non-profit, for-profit, and community interests.

How it works: Inspired by the three branches of government: A non-profit foundation owns the trademark and handles education/meetups; a for-profit entity (Automattic) holds a commercial license to monetize and fund development; and the open-source community (.org) builds and maintains the core software.

### Two CEO Scenarios That Justify Feature Teams (In defense of feature team product managers)
Two common business scenarios where a CEO rationally chooses to run feature teams rather than empowered teams

How it works: Scenario 1: Staying Ahead (Defensive Play)
- Situation: Your competitor launches a new capability
- Trigger: Customers notice and start asking when you'll have it
- CEO fear: Losing customers to the competitor
- Decision: Build the feature as a defensive play to protect revenue

Scenario 2: Displacing Incumbent (Offensive Play)
- Situation: You're a vertical B2B SaaS company attempting to displace a legacy player
- Context: Well-known domain with clear jobs to be done
- CEO belief: Reaching feature parity on certain must-haves is the only way to win deals
- Decision: Fund a multi-quarter feature roadmap

Product leader responsibility in both scenarios: Help the CEO understand the tradeoffs of various paths, make the case for a more strategic approach, but ultimately commit to the CEO's decision once made. Failure to commit irreparably damages trust with the CEO.

### When to Hire Your First PM Decision Framework (The unconventional Palantir principles that catalyzed a generation of startups)
A decision framework for founders and CEOs on when (and whether) to add formal product management roles, based on Palantir's experience of operating without a product organization for years.

How it works: Core insight: Communication and customer-sensing pathways are lossy in three ways:
1. Lossy in fidelity about the actual customer's needs
2. Lossy in holding the founder's vision across team members
3. Lossy in how easily the best engineering ideas get applied to problems

Decision matrix:
- IF product is gaining user and monetary traction WITHOUT a product person → forgo one until you hit a scale crunch point
- IF traction pathways are lagging → you need either product coaching OR a strong, value-driven product person
- IF you are pre-product-market-fit → founder should get coaching on product rather than delegating
- IF the technical bar for understanding the problem is high (emerging tech) → lean model adds even more efficiency

Warnings:
- Adding a PM who isn't tethered to value may stall progress
- A scrum master, product owner, or project manager masquerading as a PM is almost always unhelpful (cites Marty Cagan)
- Where product is already working organically, don't insert more product people for a neater org chart

Alternative approach (Palantir model):
- Put great engineers and domain experts as close as possible to actual problems
- Make space for something great to happen
- People fulfill the RESPONSIBILITIES of product (finding value, experimenting, building, aligning, making it work for the business) without the title

Lessons:
1. Empower people to do the work of product without requiring a product organization in early days
2. Be possessive of the CPO role, but don't pretend you know how to do it just because you are the founder
3. Put great engineers and creative disciplines as close as possible to actual problems
4. Where product is already working organically, don't insert more product people for a neater org chart

### Whiteboard Reteaming (Heidi Helfand)
A transparent method for planning team reorganizations by visualizing proposed structures and open roles on a whiteboard for employee input.

How it works: Create a board with future team structures, team names, missions, open slots for hiring, and current people's names. Invite employees to review, correct mistakes, and express interest in open roles.

### Zero-to-One Incubation Structure (Garrett Lord)
Organizational design for building a startup inside a mature company.

How it works: Requires total separation: separate engineering, design, accounts, finance, all-hands, onboarding, and recruiting. The leader must spend 80%+ of their time on the new business, and team members must have zero responsibilities in the core business. Use a strict weekly/monthly/quarterly metrics cadence.

## Templates

### Areas of Responsibility (AORs) List (Emily Kramer)
A directory used at Asana to track the Directly Responsible Individual (DRI) for every specific task or product area, independent of job titles.

How it works: Break down responsibilities granularly (e.g., 'DRI for onboarding tests' vs 'Copywriter for onboarding'). Makes it easy for cross-functional teams to know exactly who to consult.

### Areas of Responsibility (AORs) Spreadsheet Template (How to get your marketing team to drive more impact)
A spreadsheet template for creating a shared list of ownership areas across marketing and cross-functional teams, learned from Asana's internal system.

How it works: Google Sheets link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TYB3N8Q8IzMfi7lJc04VLX2i6KIQ1flxPv6fUzhXMbY/edit#gid=0

How it works:
- Create a shared list of responsibilities for each employee, grouped by team or sub-team
- Purpose: anyone in the company can look up exactly who owns what (e.g., product onboarding copy, transactional emails, web analytics)
- AORs are NOT job titles — they are specific ownership areas where the employee is the DRI
- If multiple people own an area, get more granular until only one person owns each area
- Each individual is responsible for keeping their responsibilities updated
- Update every time there's a role/responsibility change or new hire
- For cross-team ownership, list both owners: 'Onboarding—marketing collaborator: Emily' and 'Onboarding—product DRI: Lenny'
- Includes many early- and growth-stage marketing responsibilities pre-listed
- Can also work in Asana project or Notion doc

### Head of AI Operations Role (Dan Shipper)
A new organizational role dedicated to increasing company-wide leverage through AI.

How it works: This person sits outside day-to-day firefighting. They meet weekly with team members to identify repetitive tasks, then build prompts, workflows, and automations (e.g., automated copy-editing pull requests) so the team can work faster without breaking their flow.

### Ownership Spreadsheet (This Week #9: Breaking into growth, leading with influence, and (not) stepping on toes 🦶)
A simple spreadsheet template for mapping product areas to teams after a re-org to reduce ambiguity

How it works: Structure:
- Rows: Every product area that exists (features, surfaces, bug categories, etc.)
- Columns: Each team in the organization
- Cells: Mark which team owns each product area

Rules:
- Every product area must be assigned to exactly one team, even if the fit isn't perfect
- Especially important for assigning bugs
- If there's disagreement, a senior leader makes the call
- Nothing is permanent — adjust if things aren't working
- Prioritize making a decision over making the perfect decision
- Update after every re-org

### PM Career Ladder Template (Google Sheets) (Skills PMs need to build)
A set of Google Sheets templates for building your own PM career ladder/leveling framework

How it works: Google Sheets template available at: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fEY8JnLhvjci1F-twKOFK7gh8Z0SwXCdMxOxXrXZEhw/edit#gid=1925149295

Key design recommendations from Lenny:
- Target 5-9 top-level PM attributes (median across companies is 5, average is ~7)
- Slack and Instacart use 4 attributes, Mixpanel uses 9, Uber uses 19
- Include levels from APM/PM I through VP/CPO
- For each attribute at each level, describe specific behavioral expectations
- Common naming conventions: PM Competencies, PM Leveling Framework, PM Career Tracks, PM Job Ladder, PM Career Map, PM Attributes, PM Role Guideline, PM Pathway, PM Titles and Role Expectations

### Roles and Responsibilities Contract (Nikita Miller)
A template used to define expectations between product, design, engineering, and data.

How it works: The template covers three areas: 1) Expectations as an IC, 2) Expectations as a manager/with your team, 3) Expectations of each other (shared responsibilities). Each person writes their own and what they expect of counterparts, then they review together to form a contract.

### Vibe Coder Role Definition (Elena Verna 4.0)
A new organizational role focused on rapid prototyping and building using AI coding assistants.

How it works: Can be a non-technical person (e.g., former Chief of Staff). Responsibilities include rapidly building functional prototypes, internal tools, and marketing assets using AI tools to bypass traditional engineering bottlenecks.

## Checklists

### CEO/CPO Alignment Questionnaire (Manik Gupta)
A set of questions for a CEO to answer before hiring a CPO or VP of Product to ensure clear swimlanes.

How it works: Questions to ask the CEO: What do you want to spend your time on? Do you still want to own the product roadmap and execution? Are you optimizing for process, strategy, or team building/attracting talent? How do you view the intersection of engineering, data science, and design?

### DS Team Centralization to Embedding Transition Checklist (Fostering a culture of experimentation)
Steps and considerations for transitioning from a centralized data science team to an embedded model

How it works: When to transition: Around ~25 DS people, when centralized ad-hoc support becomes a bottleneck.
How to embed: Place at least one full-time DS on each product team. DS should participate in roadmap planning alongside PMs, engineers, and designers. Have a DS at every level of leadership team.
Mitigate downsides: (1) Create a central knowledge repo for shared learnings. (2) Create a metrics repo as a single source of truth. (3) Build a data portal for self-service access. (4) Centralize processes and tooling across DS sub-teams to maintain trust and consistency.
Culture practices: Run bi-weekly experiment reviews focused on lessons learned, mistakes, and next steps. Encourage DS to propose product ideas, not just analyze.

### Org Model Selection Diagnostic (General management, functional, and hybrid models: Which org design works best for top companies?)
A set of questions and criteria synthesized from the newsletter to help leaders evaluate which org model is right for their company

How it works: Questions to evaluate:

1. Company Stage:
- Do you have multiple proven product groups? (Yes → consider GM)
- Do you have predictable business outcomes? (Yes → consider GM)
- Are you at significant scale (hundreds of millions+ revenue, thousands of employees)? (Yes → consider GM)
- Are you still finding PMF or scaling a core product? (Yes → stay functional)

2. North Star Metric Proximity to Revenue:
- Is your North Star metric directly tied to revenue (e.g., transaction volume)? → GM model
- Is your North Star metric removed from revenue (e.g., engagement, growth)? → Functional model
- Are both product and operational metrics equally important? → Hybrid model

3. Customer Journey Importance:
- Is a cohesive, seamless customer journey critical to growth? → Functional model
- Are your product lines serving distinct segments independently? → GM model

4. Team Redundancy:
- Can your business afford redundant functional teams across business units? → GM model is feasible
- Do you need shared infrastructure with data network effects? → Centralized platform + hybrid

5. Talent Goals:
- Do you need deep domain experts for specific business areas? → GM model
- Do you need flexible, fungible crafters across projects? → Functional model
- Do you need diverse career ladders to retain both types? → Hybrid model

### Outcome-Oriented vs. Product-Oriented Diagnostic (This Week #13: Balancing outcome-thinking with design and technical requirements ⚖️)
Three diagnostic questions to determine whether your organization is structured around outcomes or around product/surface areas.

How it works: Ask these three questions about your organization:
1. Do you organize teams around a goal, or around product/surface areas?
2. Are teams encouraged to work on any part of the product to achieve their goals, or are they pushed to stay within their lanes?
3. Do teams build a strategy and roadmap rooted in a business goal, or rooted in making the products/features they own more successful?

If your answers lean toward goals, cross-product freedom, and business-goal-rooted strategy, you are outcome-oriented. If they lean toward surface areas, lanes, and feature-centric roadmaps, you are product-oriented.

### PM Career Ladder Design Decisions Checklist (Product management career ladders)
Key structural decisions to make when building a PM career ladder, derived from patterns across 20+ companies

How it works: Key decisions when designing your PM career ladder:
1. Will you have both an IC and a manager track? (Two-thirds of companies do)
2. At what level will IC and manager tracks diverge? (Most common: L6 / Sr. PM)
3. Will you include an APM role? (Two-thirds of companies do)
4. Will you include a Principal PM role? (Two-thirds of companies do)
5. Will you include a Senior PM role? (Over 80% of companies do)
6. Will you include a Lead PM / Product Lead role? (Only 25% do)
7. Will you use title inflation or keep titles flat? (Stripe, Airbnb, Lyft, Facebook try to avoid title inflation — Stripe uses 'Product Manager' at every IC level)
8. What competencies/attributes will you evaluate on? (Top 10: Leadership, Impact, Scope, Execution, Communication, Vision, Strategy, Collaboration, Planning, Technical skills)

### PM Career Ladder Naming and Sizing Checklist (Skills PMs need to build)
Guidelines for naming and structuring your PM career ladder document based on patterns observed across 20+ companies

How it works: Common names for PM leveling frameworks:
1. PM Competencies
2. PM Leveling Framework
3. PM Career Tracks
4. PM Job Ladder
5. PM Career Map
6. PM Attributes
7. PM Role Guideline
8. PM Pathway
9. PM Titles and Role Expectations

Sizing guidelines:
- Median number of top-level PM attributes: 5
- Average number of top-level PM attributes: ~7
- Minimum observed: 4 (Slack, Instacart)
- Maximum observed: 19 (Uber)
- Recommended sweet spot: 5-9 attributes

### Principles for Professional Reporting Structure (How Gong builds product)
Rationale and criteria for organizing reporting lines through professional chains rather than embedding functions within product teams

How it works: 1. Knowledge professionals prefer reporting to someone with the same career path (analyst → head of analytics, not → PM).
2. Tension between PMs and other functions (design, analytics) is healthy — PMs focus on delivery speed, designers worry about quality.
3. If designers report to PMs, it steers the ship too close to delivery at the expense of quality.
4. Writing function placed within UX team due to strong connection between writing and product UX — both ensure end users understand what to do on a page.
5. All functions (product, design, analytics, operations) report to CPO but through their professional chain.
6. At Gong: 24 PMs in 6 groups, all designers report to head of product design, all analysts report to head of analytics.

### Six Counter-Conventional Practices at Linear (How Linear builds product)
A summary of Linear's most distinctive organizational and product practices that go against industry norms.

How it works: 1. No product managers, just a head of product — PM duties are distributed across engineering and design
2. No durable cross-functional teams — Teams assemble around a project and disperse once the project is done
3. No metrics-based goals — Just a North Star company-level metric goal
4. No A/B tests — Decisions are based on taste and opinions
5. Job candidates go through a paid work trial — They join the team for 1-5 days and work on a real project with the team
6. The team is completely remote — And always has been

### Team Contract Template (How Ramp builds product)
A published contract each product team must create to justify their existence and align with the rest of the organization

How it works: Every team must publish visibly and clearly:
1. A goal: what they want to achieve
2. A strategy: how they will win
3. A roadmap: what they will build
4. Metrics: how they are measured
5. User flows: the UX
6. Underlying systems: the tech
7. Stakeholders: who they work with

### Three Approaches to Managing Ambiguous Ownership (This Week #9: Breaking into growth, leading with influence, and (not) stepping on toes 🦶)
A graduated set of strategies for handling unclear product area ownership as a PM team scales, from simplest to most complex

How it works: Approach 1 — Communicate, then proceed: Notify leadership and associated teams that you plan to tackle a project in an ambiguous area. Ask them to let you know by a specific date if they disagree. If you don't hear back, go for it. Communicate progress regularly. Don't block on waiting for approval — it's a heads up, not a request. If there's pushback, ensure it's based on concrete reasons, not land-grab politicking. Culture principle: impact > ownership.

Approach 2 — Make an ownership spreadsheet: After every re-org, create a spreadsheet with product areas as rows and teams as columns. Assign every product area to a team, even if it doesn't fit perfectly. Especially important for bug assignment. If there's disagreement, have a senior leader make a call. Nothing is set in stone — adjust if needed. Making a decision matters more than making the perfect decision.

Approach 3 — Organize teams around outcomes, not features: Instead of owning 'the Dashboard,' a team would own 'Increase user engagement' and can work on any part of the product to achieve that outcome. Avoids over-optimizing features that aren't driving impact. Breaks the concept of clean product surface-area divisions. Referenced as a critical ingredient in Airbnb's success (see Jonathan Golden's First Round Review post).

### Who's in the Room Checklist (What jury duty taught me about product management)
Five areas where PMs should be super-selective about who they include, inspired by jury selection

How it works: When staffing or organizing, evaluate these five dimensions:
1. Projects: Who's going to help you align, make decisions, and ship — and who's going to derail everything?
2. Meetings: Who's going to help you get to the outcome you want — and who's going to create confusion?
3. Leadership team: Who'll do real work and push the team forward, and who just wants to be involved?
4. Success criteria: How could you set your team up for success before you even start the project? How will success be judged?
5. Career: Is the place you work full of people who are better than you, or do you constantly need to pull everyone along?

## Examples

### Airbnb Org Model Oscillation (General management, functional, and hybrid models: Which org design works best for top companies?)
How Airbnb moved to GM model for expansion, then reverted to functional after divesting new business bets

How it works: Company: Airbnb
First transition: ~10 years after founding → GM-led model. Trigger: Company was a few thousand employees, expanding beyond accommodations (e.g., experiences). Different business lines ran differently and required fast decision-making.
Second transition: Back to function-led structure. Trigger: Pandemic forced divestment from new business bets (experiences, etc.), removing the need for separate GM-led units.
Key insight: Companies can and do oscillate between models as their business portfolio and strategic priorities change.

### Airbnb Outcome-Oriented Team Examples (This Week #13: Balancing outcome-thinking with design and technical requirements ⚖️)
Concrete examples of how Airbnb structured teams around outcomes rather than product areas.

How it works: Example 1: Airbnb had a team oriented around the outcome of 'getting hosts more bookings,' NOT a team owning the 'host products' that then figured out how to drive bookings.

Example 2: Airbnb had a team focused on the outcome of 'improving trip quality,' NOT a team owning the 'reviews product' that then figured out how to drive up quality.

Example 3 (technical investment): Airbnb decided whether to invest significant resources into migrating from a monolith codebase into stand-alone services (SOA) by laying out scenarios of doing it now, doing some now, or doing none now, and evaluating across five criteria.

Key operational note: In an outcome-oriented model, you still need to assign ownership of product areas to teams (for bug triaging if nothing else) and create processes for teams to help each other when working in unfamiliar code. But these are secondary to working backward from the outcome.

### Airbnb Supply Growth Team Focus Restructure (What Seven Years at Airbnb Taught Me About Building a Business)
How Airbnb restructured a spread-thin supply growth team into focused units to drive gains in impact and morale.

How it works: Problem: A small team was spread across a long funnel, seeing wins but unable to build real momentum. Solution: 1) Divided team into focused units — a team driving referrals, a team owning top-of-funnel organic growth, a team owning performance marketing, etc. 2) Grew each team with resources appropriate to that problem space. For trip quality: dedicated a quarter at a time to a specific aspect (host response rate, guest review rate, etc.). Once they found a large opportunity, doubled down in the subsequent quarter. Result: Gains in both impact and morale.

### Airbnb's Outcome-Based Team Structure (This Week #9: Breaking into growth, leading with influence, and (not) stepping on toes 🦶)
How Airbnb organized cross-functional teams around outcomes rather than product features

How it works: Airbnb's founders built cross-functional teams around 'Outcomes' rather than 'Product Features.' Example: Instead of a team owning 'the Dashboard,' a team would own 'Increase user engagement' and could work on any part of the product needed to achieve that outcome. Benefits: avoids over-optimizing features that aren't driving impact, breaks the idea of clean divisions of product surface-area ownership. Lenny describes this as a critical ingredient in Airbnb's success. Reference: Jonathan Golden's First Round Review post 'The Power of the Elastic Product Team.'

### Block (Square) GM to Functional Transition (General management, functional, and hybrid models: Which org design works best for top companies?)
Real-world example of Block/Square transitioning from a GM-led organization back to a functional model, including the CEO's rationale

How it works: Company: Block (formerly Square)
Transition: GM-led → Functional model (late 2023)
Context: Block laid off ~10% of headcount. For years, Square's product and engineering teams were organized into separate business units, each led by a GM who owned business outcomes and product mandates.
New structure: Product and engineering centralized into functional organizations. Engineering, product, and design discipline leaders co-lead product metrics that drive business outcomes.
CEO rationale (Jack Dorsey to shareholders): 'The past organizational structure was holding us back, slowing us down, and weakening our skills. I want Square to be a leader in engineering and design again.'
Original transition to GM: Happened close to IPO, when Block had hundreds of millions in revenue, extensive product portfolio (Cash App, Capital, Invoices), and thousands of employees.
Redundancy example: Square and Cash App had mirrored corporate structures (compliance, communications, marketing) and even separate physical offices.

### Canva Hybrid Model (Product Teams + GMs for Content) (General management, functional, and hybrid models: Which org design works best for top companies?)
Canva's hybrid approach pairing product teams with GMs to scale both its platform and content library

How it works: Company: Canva
Model: Hybrid — product leaders paired with GMs
Product teams: Build Canva's scalable content creation software.
GMs: Lead enablement of hundreds of content experts to produce rich content library of 125M+ templates and media.
Key insight: Separation of duties allows Canva to grow both its platform and content templates in parallel — one of its key business differentiators.

### Coinbase and Intuit Hybrid Models with Centralized Platforms (General management, functional, and hybrid models: Which org design works best for top companies?)
How Coinbase and Intuit use centralized platform teams alongside GM business units in a hybrid structure

How it works: Coinbase:
- Shifted to GM structure late 2022 with multi-billions in revenue
- Three business areas: institutions, consumers, developers
- Centralized platform teams build shared services (AI modeling, identity, security)
- GM-led business units build products unique to customer segments
- Horizontal product groups (platform, growth) span business units for senior leader breadth

Intuit:
- B2B business area: QuickBooks and Mailchimp
- Consumer business area: TurboTax and Credit Karma
- Centralized platform teams alongside GM business units
- Platform groups leverage data network effects for intelligent, consistent application layers
- Horizontal groups afford opportunities for senior leaders to take on GM-like breadth responsibilities

### Companies with flat PM title structures (Product management career ladders)
Examples of companies that deliberately avoid title inflation for PM IC roles

How it works: Four companies try to avoid PM title inflation and stick to 'Product Manager' for the majority of IC levels: Stripe, Airbnb, Lyft, and Facebook. Stripe is the most extreme example, officially using the 'Product Manager' title at every IC level.

### Company Leadership Type Examples (This Week #11: What should new PMs over-index on, and empowering product in a sales-driven org)
Real company examples categorized by what function drives their growth

How it works: Product-led: Coinbase, Dropbox, Instagram
Engineering-led: Facebook, Stripe
Sales-led: Salesforce, most B2B businesses
Marketing-led: Casper, Hims, most DTC businesses

### DoorDash Hybrid Model (Product Leaders + GMs) (General management, functional, and hybrid models: Which org design works best for top companies?)
DoorDash's hybrid approach pairing product leaders with GMs for its complex logistics-driven business

How it works: Company: DoorDash
Model: Hybrid — product leaders paired alongside GMs
Rationale: Product and operational metrics are both equally important to business topline and margins due to complex go-to-market and logistics operations.
Product leaders: Responsible for product growth and engagement, with typical EPD (engineering, product, design) triads.
GMs: Lead go-to-market and operations (marketing, sales, partnerships, physical micro-fulfillment centers) with P&L responsibilities.
Key insight: Separation of duties allows both product innovation and operational excellence to scale in parallel.

### Duolingo Product Areas and Teams Map (How Duolingo builds product)
The actual list of product areas and teams within them at Duolingo

How it works: Product Areas and example teams: Growth Area: Retention team (owns CURR metric), New User Activation, Reactivation, Connections (social features). Monetization Area: Subscriptions, In-App Purchases (owns IAP revenue), Ads. Total area owns Duolingo app revenue = IAP + ads + subscription. Emerging Products: Math app team (pre-PMF, 90/10 new features allocation), Music. Learning & Curriculum, Platform, and other areas also exist. (Full list was shown in an image; above captures the explicitly named teams and areas from the text.)

### Figma's Product Org Structure (How Figma builds product)
How Figma organizes its product team of 22 PMs across products and platforms.

How it works: 22 PMs total. Organization: Two product-focused teams (Figma Design team, FigJam team) + horizontal platform teams that span both products (Enterprise group — making both products great for large enterprises; Infrastructure group — reliability and performance of both products). Reporting: Design, Research, and PM all under Product org. VP of Design → CPO. Director of Product Research → CPO. All PMs → CPO. CPO → CEO. Historical note: PMs previously reported to head of engineering before CPO role existed. Previously organized around product surfaces (corresponding to use cases) when single-product.

### GitHub Next (vNext) Team Model (Inbal S)
An organizational structure for an applied research team that successfully bridges the gap between 3-5 year innovation and production.

How it works: Composed of applied/research scientists focusing on 3-5 year horizons. Key to success: avoiding becoming a purely academic 'university' by maintaining strong, ongoing synergies with core product and engineering teams to bring POCs to production.

### Notion's PM and Org Metrics (How Notion builds product)
Concrete data points about Notion's team size, PM ratio, and growth stats

How it works: - Total company size: ~550 people
- Number of PMs: Under 15 (out of 550)
- PM-to-company ratio: ~1 PM per 37 people
- First PM hired: When they had 50-60 engineers (approximately 2 years before the article, ~2021)
- Users: Over 20 million people and hundreds of thousands of teams
- Growth ranking: 4th fastest-growing app in the world (was #1 the prior year per Okta Businesses at Work report)
- Unified org: Engineering, PM, design, data, user research, and security all under CPTO

### Program Manager Role Examples (This Week #2: Tackling the chicken-and-egg problem, building a growth team from scratch, and addressing overlap with PM peers 🤔)
Real-world examples of what qualifies as a 'program' vs. a 'product' to help distinguish PM roles

How it works: **Program examples** (program manager scope): Bird scooter charging program, Airbnb Superhost program, Lyft ambassador program — these involve using existing products and working with ops, sales, marketing.
**Product examples** (product manager scope): Substack website, Google Maps mobile app, Slack onboarding flow — these involve building products and working with engineers, designers, researchers.

### Ramp's Pod-to-Org Mapping Structure (How Ramp builds product)
How Ramp maps the entire company, not just tech, to product goals with dedicated cross-functional resources per pod

How it works: Each product 'pod' has dedicated cross-functional resources:
- Product Marketer
- Product Operator
- Product Partnerships Lead
- Product Counsel

These roles are responsible for quarterbacking the product strategy within their respective organizations. This ensures single-threaded teams have the resources they need to execute on big opportunities.

### Rippling Time and Attendance Launch (Jeremy Henrickson)
A case study of how Rippling launches new products using a tiny, isolated team.

How it works: Rippling assigned one highly talented systems engineer and a design partner, isolated them from the rest of the suite (payroll, benefits), and had them focus monomaniacally for 9 months to build the product from scratch.

### SecureDocs Isolation Pattern (Heidi Helfand)
A real-world example of incubating a successful product by isolating a team.

How it works: The team was placed in a separate physical area with impermanent walls, given a distinct name, granted process freedom (daily sprints vs two-week sprints), protected from outside interruptions by leadership, and reported directly to a senior decision-maker.

### Shopify Core's 11 JTBD-Based Teams (How Shopify builds product)
How Shopify organizes teams around merchant jobs to be done with examples

How it works: 11 teams within Core, each oriented around a merchant job to be done. Named examples: - Online Store: Semi-standalone, manages the storefront. - Checkout: Semi-standalone, world-leading checkout conversion. Highly metrics-driven. - Merchandising: JTBD is 'how to set up and sell products.' - Engage: Focuses on marketing and customer engagement/segmentation. Challenger against Salesforce Marketing Cloud. - Build: Manages the developer platform. - [Unnamed]: Manages the app ecosystem and its dynamics. Key principle: No 'Enterprise Team' or 'Small Business Team.' Every team must think about the full spectrum from 'hello world through to IPO.' Goal is a smooth scaling curve with no rough edges where merchants feel they've hit a ceiling. Maturity varies: Checkout is world-leading by a wide margin; Engage is more of an upstart/challenger.

### Shopify Functional Model and Organic Growth Flywheel (General management, functional, and hybrid models: Which org design works best for top companies?)
How Shopify's shift from GM to functional model enabled a cohesive merchant experience and organic growth flywheels

How it works: Company: Shopify
Transition: GM → Functional model (2020)
Core product: Single 'back-office' for e-commerce merchants (websites, payments, order management).
Extended needs: Before/after transaction needs (marketing, fulfillment) served through first- and third-party apps/services.
Result of functional shift: Easier to deliver seamless merchant experience across suite of core back-office products. Synergies across core product lines enabled: (1) scaling across customer segments, (2) organic attachment of apps/services in-flow (vs. ad-like cross-sell strategies).
Tradeoff: Takes longer to win specific verticals (e.g., fulfillment) through apps, but overarching merchant experience is highly defensible and sticky.
Outcome: Shopify became the sole system of record and engagement for many customers.
Hybrid element: Uses champions leading company-level priorities across disciplines and organizations, akin to GMs.

### Shopify's Two-Division Org Structure (How Shopify builds product)
How Shopify reorganized from 10 GM-led business units to 2 divisions to improve product cohesion

How it works: Before (~2018): 10 GMs, each with all functions (product, eng, UX, etc.) for their business unit. Problem: Product felt incohesive, you could see the org chart through the product. After (~2021): 2 divisions. Division 1 - Core (Glen's org): What's in the box when you buy Shopify—all included features, online store, checkout, Admin. Contains 11 teams organized around merchant JTBD. Product, UX, marketing, ops, partnerships report to VP Product. Engineering and data have separate functional orgs. Division 2 - Merchant Services: Optional add-ons—POS, payment processing, shipping labels. Also includes Shop (buyer-facing brand, wallet, package tracker, shopping). Key principle (Conway's Law): The org chart and the actual product should be as close to the same thing as possible. Trade-off acknowledged: Very large teams requiring centralized coordination, but product cohesion is the priority.

### Web3 Organizations Without PMs (A product manager’s guide to web3)
Real examples demonstrating that successful web3 projects often operate without product managers

How it works: - Ethereum Foundation: 97 employees, stewards a $500B Layer 1 protocol with virtually zero PMs
- World of Women (NFT project): Has artists, head of philanthropy, legal counsel — but no PMs
- General DeFi/NFT pattern: Teams mainly need a developer, a community manager, and a protocol designer (DeFi) or artist (NFTs)

## Tools

### Make.WordPress.org (Matt Mullenweg)
A central hub for organizing community contributions to an open-source project.

How it works: Divides contributions into specific functional groups: accessibility, design, core code, plugins, translation, support, documentation, and event organization.
