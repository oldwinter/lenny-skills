# Product Taste and Intuition - Frameworks, Templates & Checklists

*69 artifacts extracted from Lenny's Podcast and Newsletter*

## Frameworks

### Adapt When Adopting Framework (How Duolingo reignited user growth)
A three-question framework for evaluating whether to borrow a feature from another product and how to adapt it to your own context

How it works: When looking to adopt a feature from another product, ask yourself:
1. Why is this feature working in that product?
2. Why might this feature succeed or fail in our context, i.e. will it translate well?
3. What adaptations are necessary to make this feature succeed in our context?

Anti-pattern examples:
- Gardenscapes moves counter failed at Duolingo because: In Gardenscapes, each move is a strategic decision to outmaneuver dynamic obstacles. In Duolingo, users either know the answer or they don't—no strategy involved. The counter was just a boring, tacked-on nuisance.
- Uber-style referral program failed at Duolingo because: Uber riders pay on a never-ending pay-as-you-go system (free ride = constant incentive). Duolingo's best/most active users already had Super Duolingo subscriptions, so they couldn't receive the free month reward—excluding the exact users the strategy needed most.

Success example:
- FarmVille 2 leaderboards succeeded at Duolingo because: The core mechanic (competition based on engagement closeness rather than personal relationships, plus league progression) translated well. But additional task complexity was deliberately left out because it would add unnecessary friction to language learning. Users were auto-opted in and could progress simply by consistent study.

### Aim for Chartres (Nabeel S. Qureshi)
A mental model for setting the highest possible quality bar for your work.

How it works: Originating from architect Christopher Alexander, the concept is to imagine the Chartres Cathedral in France and aim to build something better than that, rather than settling for average or 'good enough' work.

### Copy First, Then Innovate Decision Framework (The secret to Duolingo’s exponential growth)
A two-part framework for deciding when to copy proven mechanics vs. innovate with new approaches

How it works: Default approach: Copy first
- For any widespread industry concept, start with a system that closely resembles an existing successful one, adapted to your app
- Your first MVP of an existing, widespread mechanic is NOT the time to get clever and innovative
- The app marketplace is essentially a genetic algorithm—winning concepts have been refined through billions of A/B test treatments

When to innovate (two scenarios):
1. When you're already at the cutting edge - Example: Duolingo's notifications. Once you're the leader, push boundaries rather than waiting for others to innovate. (Netflix analogy: mail DVDs → streaming, staying ahead of their own disruption)
2. After launching a solid MVP based on best-in-class industry standards - First implement or at least experiment with and reject the major features of others' implementations, THEN explore independent ideas

Duolingo leaderboard example:
- Studied: Gardenscapes, Golf Clash, Toon Blast
- Winning design (4th iteration): Opt-out, groups of 30 per week, promotion/demotion between leagues, auto-tuned difficulty matching, rewards for top 3
- Results: D1 retention +1%, D7 +2%, D14 +3%, time spent learning +17%

### Cover Band vs. Original Song Analogy (First-principles thinking)
Ozan Varol's analogy distinguishing reasoning by analogy from first-principles thinking

How it works: Reasoning by analogy = being a cover band (playing someone else's music with slight variations). This is how we get through most of life—copying what others do. It's efficient.

First-principles thinking = going back to the fundamental raw materials of music (the notes) and building an original song from scratch. It's really difficult because most of what we do is informed by what we've done before and what others do around us.

Key tradeoff: First-principles thinking taken to an extreme is really inefficient. The critical skill is picking what to question, because you can't question every single thing. Use knowledge to inform, not constrain.

### Design for tomorrow's users, not today's vocal minority (Tamar Yehoshua)
When making product changes, design for the larger future user base rather than optimizing for the smaller current user base that will be vocal about changes.

How it works: Principle: The number of people using your product today is usually far smaller than the number who will use it tomorrow. Design for the bigger number. When making changes: 1) Be respectful and transparent about why. 2) Be authentic — no marketing speak. 3) Listen to your audience — make people feel heard. 4) Give people choice and enough time to transition. 5) Don't be dismissive. Apply to: UI redesigns, feature removals, migrations (e.g., Slack Calls to Huddles).

### Don't eat your own bullshit (Tanguy Crusson)
A principle about not assuming past success patterns will automatically apply to new products or markets

How it works: Combines Atlassian's 'open company, no bullshit' value with dogfooding practice. Core insight: teams tend to believe success came from X without validating that assumption, then apply X to new bets without testing. Example: Atlassian assumed bottom-up adoption from tech teams would work for HipChat in business teams (it didn't - Slack won business users). Fix: Explain why you are successful today, then if you think the same playbook applies to the new thing, find ways to validate that assumption before building on it.

### Five Pillars of Game Design for Products (Rahul Vohra)
Superhuman's framework for applying game design (not gamification) to business software, covering goals, emotions, toys, controls, and flow

How it works: Five pillars: Goals, Emotions, Toys, Controls, Flow. Key principle: 'Make fun toys and combine them into games.' A toy is fun without a goal (a ball), a game adds structure (football). Test for toys: Does the feature indulge playful exploration? Is it fun even without a goal? Does it elicit moments of pleasant surprise? Avoid gamification (points, badges, rewards) as it undermines intrinsic motivation per the Stanford drawing study.

### Four Practices for Building Product Sense (How to develop product sense)
A structured set of four practices organized under empathy-building and creativity-building, with recommended time investment for each.

How it works: Building Empathy:
1. Observe people interacting with products (2-4 times/month for your product)
2. Deconstruct everyday products (1-2 hours/month trying new products)

Improving Creativity:
3. Learn from great product thinkers (attend product reviews, read/watch their content)
4. Be curious about changes in technology and your domain (track macro and micro trends)

### Game Recognize Game (Taste Test) (Shreyas Doshi Live)
A mental model for evaluating whether you truly have taste: can you identify greatness before results prove it?

How it works: Taste = ability to identify what is really good WITHOUT needing to see its results. Example: Saying Jensen Huang is a genius in 2024 requires zero taste (just look up NVIDIA stock price). Saying it in 2010 requires real taste — Jensen didn't change, only the visible results did. 'Game recognize game before the game is called' — in the practice session, not after the championship. Corollary: Being a tough grader who says everything is crap also requires zero taste.

### Golden Gut (Scott Belsky)
The product intuition that experienced product thinkers develop through exposure — knowing when to remove steps, use presumptuous defaults, trade off 10% confusion for 90% speed improvement, and reduce cognitive load

How it works: Built by: 1) Having designers in the room during customer research and value proposition debates (bringing design upstream). 2) Developing instincts for 'I wonder if' questions: What if we removed this entirely? What if we used a presumptuous default? What if we separated this into three steps? 3) Making micro-decisions about cognitive load trade-offs. Difference between junior and senior: experienced thinkers have the instinct that even if 10% get confused, getting 90% through faster is a great opportunity cost trade-off.

### Intuition as a Hypothesis Generator (Dylan Field)
A mental model for treating product intuition not as absolute truth, but as a starting point for debate.

How it works: Step 1: Generate hypotheses based on intuition. Step 2: Put them forward and debate them. Step 3: Find data to support or negate them. Step 4: Winnow down to a working hypothesis to move forward.

### Lenny's Gift Curation Criteria (Lenny’s Newsletter holiday gift guide 2024)
The implicit framework Lenny uses to select products for recommendation, applicable to any curated list or product review

How it works: Lenny's curation criteria for gift/product recommendations:
1. **Useful** — The product solves a real problem or improves daily life
2. **Timeless** — Not trendy or faddish; will still be relevant and appreciated years from now
3. **High-quality** — Premium materials, good design, durable
4. **Personally tested** — Products Lenny regularly uses and loves (primary filter)
5. **Community-validated** — Recommended by podcast guests, readers on X/LinkedIn, or trusted reviewers like Wirecutter
6. **Transparent about conflicts** — Disclose any financial relationships (angel investments, sponsorships) with an asterisk
7. **No affiliate fees** — No financial incentive biasing the recommendations

Sourcing mix: Personal favorites + podcast guest recommendations (via lennyslightninground.com) + community crowdsourcing (X and LinkedIn threads) + spouse/family input for blind spots

### Lenny's Gift Curation Principles (A holiday gift guide for tech people with taste 🤌)
The implicit criteria Lenny uses to select items for his gift guide, which can be applied when curating any recommendation list

How it works: Principles for curating a high-trust recommendation list:
1. Theme-driven: Each year has a clear theme (2025: 'taste' — high-quality, non-obvious products)
2. No financial incentives: No affiliate links, no investments in recommended companies (with one transparently disclosed exception)
3. Personal experience: Only recommend things you personally love and use
4. Range of price points: Include both high-end/handmade and affordable options
5. Organize by recipient persona: Group by who you're shopping for (home, parents, gadget lovers, stressed founders, splurgers)
6. Include 'returning champions': Resurface past recommendations that continue to drive positive feedback
7. Community-sourced additions: Include reader/community recommendations as a bonus section
8. Transparency: Clearly disclose any relationship or deal (e.g., the Matic vacuum disclosure)
9. Values alignment: Thread personal values throughout (e.g., microplastic-free, organic, screen-free for kids)
10. Invite participation: Ask readers to share their own favorites in comments

### Lenny's Gift Guide Curation Methodology (Lenny’s Newsletter Holiday Gift Guide 2022)
The approach Lenny uses to curate product recommendations with trust and transparency

How it works: Principles: 1) Only recommend products you have personally used and found amazing. 2) Supplement with community-sourced recommendations (Twitter threads). 3) Clearly separate personally-tested items from untested 'honorable mentions'. 4) No affiliate links — maintain trust by not monetizing recommendations. 5) Disclose any financial connections (e.g., investor relationships) with a disclaimer. 6) For investor-backed products, note that investment came AFTER product love. 7) Organize by use-case categories (Sleep/Health, Work, Out & About, Home, Art/Books). 8) Include price-range diversity within categories.

### Lenny's Gift Selection Criteria (Lenny’s holiday gift guide)
Implicit framework for how Lenny curates product recommendations: personal daily use, specific problem solved, and genuine enthusiasm

How it works: Lenny's selection criteria for recommending products:
1. Personal daily use — every item is something Lenny personally uses and loves
2. Solves a specific problem — each product addresses a clear pain point (focus, distraction, travel friction, writing quality)
3. Transparent about conflicts — asterisked items where he's an investor/advisor
4. Categories span work and life — productivity, travel, books, home, writing, apps, art, giving
5. Includes discount codes where available — adds tangible value to the recommendation

### Levels of Quality (Katie Dill)
A tiered approach to evaluating product quality based on user expectations.

How it works: Level 1: Baseline functionality (does it work?). Level 2: Error-free and well-rounded execution. Level 3+: Exceeds expectations, highly usable, desirable, and provides unprompted value.

### Mental Emulators (Ami Vora)
A problem-solving technique where you mentally simulate the perspective of different leaders or customers to gain fresh insights.

How it works: When stumped, 'load' a specific person into your head. Ask: 'How would [Name] approach this?' Examples: Eric for story/metaphor creation, Boz for principle-based trade-offs, Rob for dashboard/metrics focus, or a specific customer persona for product feedback.

### Mona Lisa Principle (How Miro builds product)
A quality standard principle stating that everything shipped should be something the team would be proud to put their name on, like the Mona Lisa painting

How it works: The Mona Lisa principle was created by a product leader at Miro to help teams build a strong sense of what quality is 'good enough.' The analogy: When you look at a painting, you can easily say something is a masterpiece and something is definitely not; the same is true with the product. Everything shipped should be like a Mona Lisa painting - something you'd be proud of putting your name on. To operationalize this beyond just the principle, the Design team built monthly design reviews where they review everything that was shipped and identify what is high-quality or not, using real examples as calibration (since 'a picture is worth a thousand words').

### Onion-Peeling Product Philosophy (How Notion builds product)
A metaphor for building products that serve both casual users and power users by letting them go as deep into customization as they want

How it works: Core philosophy: 'Peeling an onion' — users can go as deep into the core as they want.

Two user types to serve simultaneously:
1. **Power users**: Obsessed with tools and customization → love flexibility and generality
2. **Use-case users**: Just want something that works for their particular use case → need opinionated solutions

Development questions to ask for each feature:
1. 'How would you build support for this use case in terms of generic, reusable building blocks?'
2. 'What are things users might want to actually modify in how those blocks are assembled?'
3. 'What type of flexibility just adds unneeded entropy to the system?' (flexibility to avoid)

Trade-off acknowledgment:
- Route to final product is more circuitous than building a point solution directly
- But captures the balance of use-case specificity AND underlying generality

Contrast with other approaches:
- Opinionated/rigid products: Easy to onboard, easy to outgrow
- Very general products: Excessively complicated
- Notion's aim: Balance of both

### Optimizing for Feelings (Josh Miller)
A product development mental model that prioritizes the emotional outcome of a feature over its impact on a quantitative graph.

How it works: Before building, the team asks: 'Do we want to make them feel joy? Fast? Organized? Focused?' This feeling dictates the design and interaction choices (e.g., making a feature feel 'airy and effortless').

### Perceived Simplicity (Casey Winters)
A design approach for managing product complexity without relying on hard segmentation.

How it works: Advanced features are easily discoverable when a user looks for them, but effectively hidden if the user is not looking for them. This avoids the pitfalls of progressive disclosure or building entirely separate product tiers.

### Problem Reframing for Creative Solutions (How to develop product sense)
Stewart Butterfield's approach of deeply understanding and reframing user problems to set constraints that narrow the solution space, illustrated by Wedell-Wedellsborg's slow elevator example.

How it works: Principle: Many PMs jump into solution-finding before they truly understand the problem. This leads to ineffective solutions or indecisiveness as teams struggle to eliminate potential solutions.

Approach:
1. Invest time understanding WHY a problem exists
2. Frame the problem clearly with strong constraints
3. The constraints will naturally narrow solutions to a few options, streamlining decision-making

Example (from HBR 'Are You Solving the Right Problems?'):
- Framing A: 'The elevator is too slow' → Solutions: faster motor, better algorithm
- Framing B: 'The wait is annoying' → Solutions: add mirrors, install music, show news — fundamentally different and often cheaper/more effective solutions

Key skill: The ability to reframe problems and set opinionated constraints drives creative solutions.

### Product Sense Definition Framework (How to develop product sense)
A definition and mental model for product sense, broken into two component skills: empathy (discovering meaningful user needs) and creativity (crafting solutions that address those needs).

How it works: Product sense = the skill of consistently being able to craft products (or make changes to existing products) that have the intended impact on their users.

Two pillars:
1. EMPATHY — to discover meaningful user needs
2. CREATIVITY — to come up with solutions that effectively address those needs

You likely have good product sense if you've championed successful features or products that were NOT obvious to others.

### Restaurant/Hotel Analogy for Product Quality (What working at Figma taught me about customer obsession)
A mental model for thinking about overall product experience by imagining yourself as a host at a high-end restaurant or hotel

How it works: Imagine yourself running a high-end restaurant. Yes, you want the decor to be good, as well as the service and the food. But what you really care about is that every customer leaves feeling that they had a wonderful night. Applied to software: 'I'm just like a host, inviting my user into my application for a little bit, and I want them to have a wonderful time.' This analogy makes it easier to think holistically about product feel rather than optimizing individual components in isolation. It connects to the service-oriented mindset: you're providing an experience, not just shipping features.

### Reverse-Justifying Intuition (Jessica Hische)
An exercise for non-designers to build a vocabulary for visual design by analyzing their emotional reactions to fonts.

How it works: 1. Open a font folder or website. 2. Page through and screenshot fonts that catch your eye. 3. Write down the immediate feeling each gives you (e.g., calm, aggressive, feminine). 4. Group similar feelings and look for visual commonalities (e.g., lighter weight, generous spacing, rounded edges). 5. Ask yourself what past context or industry trend makes you associate that visual with that feeling.

### Robert Wright's Evolutionary Explanation of Dissatisfaction (What Buddhism Taught Me About Product Management)
A first-principles explanation of why humans are perpetually dissatisfied, rooted in evolutionary biology, used to understand user behavior and personal motivation.

How it works: Natural selection optimized humans to spread genes, NOT to be happy. Seeking more status, wealth, and possessions helped find more/better mates. Our intuition makes us believe we'll be happy when we get these things — and briefly we are — but it quickly and always fades. We forget how many times we've been disappointed by short-lived satisfaction, and continue seeking. This is a pernicious illusion. If we were fully satisfied with one meal, one tool, one trip — we'd be dead meat. Application to PM: Users and team members will never be permanently satisfied. Build for continuous problem-solving, not for a final 'happy state.'

### Service-Oriented Mindset (SaaS Reframe) (What working at Figma taught me about customer obsession)
A mental model that inverts the traditional product-oriented mindset. Instead of using user problems to make your product better, you use your product as a tool to solve user problems. The product is a means, not the end.

How it works: Product-Oriented Mindset: User problem → helps you → build a better product (product is the goal). Service-Oriented Mindset: Product → is a tool to → solve the user problem (user's success is the goal). Analogy: Think of your software company as a hotel or restaurant. Your customers are guests. Your job as an employee is to help people achieve their higher-level goals (e.g., 'help people do great design'). The software you write is just one tool that helps you do your job. Other tools include: answering questions directly, connecting users to other users so they can learn, offering help during research trips, etc. Application to prioritization: For a given user, is feature X or feature Y more valuable? What about for a room full of users? Or a stadium full of users? What decision best serves the most people?

### Slack's Product Principles (Noah Weiss)
A set of guiding principles used to evaluate product decisions and maintain a high craft bar.

How it works: Includes: 1) 'Be a great host' (relentlessly saving people steps, anticipating needs). 2) 'Don't make me think' (reusing existing design patterns, prioritizing comprehension over fewer clicks). 3) 'Don't make it stressful' (helping people chill out while using the software).

### The Cook and the Chef Mental Model (First-principles thinking)
Tim Urban's framework distinguishing between cooks (who follow recipes/analogy) and chefs (who think from first principles)

How it works: From Tim Urban's essay 'The Cook and the Chef: Musk's Secret Sauce':

Core principle: 'With each of these questions, the challenge is to keep asking why until you hit the floor.'

The cook follows existing recipes (reasoning by analogy). The chef understands the raw ingredients and principles and creates new recipes (first-principles thinking).

Reference: https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html

### The Cook vs. The Chef (First Principles Thinking) (Essential reading for product builders—part 1)
Tim Urban's framework distinguishing between 'cooks' who follow recipes (reasoning by analogy) and 'chefs' who reason from first principles to create new recipes.

How it works: Core concept:
- A 'cook' follows existing recipes—reasoning by analogy, doing what's been done before.
- A 'chef' reasons from first principles—understanding the raw ingredients and creating new recipes from scratch.
- This is identified as the 'secret sauce' shared by Elon Musk and many of history's most dynamic icons.
- The insight is accessible to everyone—it's not about money, intelligence, or ambition, but about HOW you think.
- The key separator: most people default to cook mode (following convention); rare individuals operate in chef mode (questioning everything from the ground up).

### The Creativity Faucet (Julian Shapiro)
A mental model for the creative process to generate original ideas.

How it works: Visualize creativity as a backed-up pipe. Step 1: Write out every bad idea to empty the 'wastewater'. Step 2: Recognize bad ideas as progress. Step 3: Allow the brain to pattern-match and avoid bad elements. Step 4: The 'clear water' of good, original ideas will follow.

### The Taste-Skill Gap (Essential reading for product builders—part 1)
Ira Glass's framework explaining that creative workers start with good taste but poor skills, and the only way to close the gap is through a high volume of work on deadlines.

How it works: The framework:
1. You get into creative work because you have good taste.
2. For the first couple of years, what you make isn't as good as your taste tells you it should be.
3. Your taste is good enough to recognize the gap, which is frustrating.
4. Many people quit at this phase.
5. Everyone who does interesting creative work went through years of this gap.
6. The solution: Do a huge volume of work. Put yourself on a deadline (weekly or monthly). It is only by going through a volume of work that you close the gap.
7. It takes a while. That's normal. Fight your way through it.

### Three Dimensions of Product Feel (What working at Figma taught me about customer obsession)
The three specific dimensions Figma focused on to get the 'feel' of their product right, applicable to any high-frequency software product

How it works: 1. Performance — Measure how fast changes display as the user edits. Hold yourself to a bar of 60 frames per second whenever possible. 2. Familiarity — Honor the long history of keyboard shortcuts and muscle memory in your category. Accommodate expected behaviors (e.g., modifier keys affecting resize behavior, keys pressed/released mid-action, advanced combo moves like holding spacebar while moving objects). 3. Consistency — Maintain an internal set of rules for how everything operates. These rules help people feel the tool is predictable, even when they can't articulate what the rules are. Covers complex scenarios like cross-file duplication, nesting, and real-time multi-user editing. Decision criteria for whether to invest in feel: How frequently is the product used? Daily-use products (communication tools, productivity tools, IDEs, spreadsheets) are where feel is make-or-break. Strategy: Accommodate existing expectations first, then find a few ways to surpass them with things that feel truly deep and useful (not gimmicky).

### Three Key Features Framework (Great ≠ Good) (Essential reading for product builders—part 1)
Paul Buchheit's product design principle: pick three key attributes or features for a new product, get those very right, and forget everything else. If a product is great at its core, it doesn't need to be good at everything.

How it works: The framework:
1. Pick three key attributes or features that define the fundamental essence and value of the product.
2. Get those three things very, very right.
3. Forget about everything else—the rest is noise.
4. If the basic product isn't compelling, adding more features won't save it.
5. Secondary and tertiary features can be added or improved later.
6. If your product needs 'everything' to be good, it's probably not very innovative.

Examples:
- iPod: (1) small enough for pocket, (2) enough storage for hours of music, (3) easy sync with Mac. No wireless, no playlist editing on device, no Ogg support.
- Gmail: (1) fast, (2) stored all email (vs. 4MB quotas), (3) innovative conversations + search UI. No rich text composer. Address book built in 2 days. Minimal secondary features.

Anti-pattern: 'More features = better' mindset is at the root of bad product design.

### Three-Chapter Product Book Framework (Robby Stein)
Robby's three core principles for building great consumer products, plus a coda on humility

How it works: Chapter 1: Deeply understand people — Use jobs-to-be-done interrogation to understand causation (why someone hires your product). Ask: Where were you? What were you doing? What brought it up? Find the 'big hire' moment. Chapter 2: Analytical rigor — Root cause analysis of problems. When metrics drop, dissect by region, device, demographic, use case. Understand problems before building solutions. Chapter 3: Design for clarity over cleverness — Use standard icons/patterns, don't reinvent when conventions exist. If something is a camera, show a camera. Don't create confusion to seem innovative. Coda: Be humble — Constantly question yourself, listen to users, be open to being wrong.

### Three-Question Product Review (Object Model Test) (Scott Belsky)
On every screen of a product, a user should be able to answer three questions: How did I get here? What do I do now? What do I do next? Used by Scott to evaluate startups and review products.

How it works: For every screen/experience in a product: 1) How did I get here? (clear breadcrumbs, navigation context) 2) What do I do now? (clear primary action, reduced cognitive load) 3) What do I do next? (clear path forward). Red flag: if a team claims to be design-driven but their demo doesn't answer these three questions on every screen.

### What-If vs. Why-Not Questions (Sam Schillace)
A framework for evaluating disruptive ideas: 'Why not' questions focus on limitations and reasons something won't work; 'What if' questions imagine the implications if it does work. Innovators should lead with 'what if' to see possibilities before getting bogged down in problems.

How it works: Step 1: When encountering a new idea, notice if your first reaction is a 'why not' (e.g., 'the browser can't support that', 'people won't trust the cloud'). Step 2: Deliberately reframe as 'what if' (e.g., 'what if we can build software around AI?', 'what if payload to space becomes cheap?'). Step 3: If the 'what if' outcome would be transformationally valuable, commit to exploring it. Step 4: Only then tackle the 'why not' problems as engineering challenges to solve. Key insight: The order matters — seeing value before difficulty keeps you motivated.

## Templates

### Competitive Product Comparison Template (How to develop product sense)
A structured comparison framework for analyzing two competing products across multiple dimensions to uncover strategic differences and design choices.

How it works: Dimensions to compare two products:
1. Target user — Who is each product designed for?
2. Key screens / core experience — What does the main UI look like? What's prioritized?
3. Onboarding experience — How does each product get users started?
4. Revenue model — How does each product make money?
5. Feature breadth — What capabilities does each product offer?
6. Differentiators — What unique value does each product provide?
7. Strategic positioning — What strategy does each product's design choices imply?

Example: Cash App vs. Venmo
- Venmo strategy: lean into social graph (friends already on it, easy identity verification)
- Cash App strategy: ease of use + breadth of capabilities for personal finance/small business from phone

### Daily Decision Log (BATF) (Kevin Yien)
A single, running text file (Big Ass Text File) used to track daily meetings, takeaways, and specifically product decisions or predictions to build product sense.

How it works: Format: Google Doc/Notion page. Bullet point the date. Add meeting names and takeaways. Use '#decision' to log a prediction (e.g., 'Company X launched Y because Z'). Set a calendar invite for 6 months later to review.

## Checklists

### 10 Fertile Questions for Challenging Assumptions (First-principles thinking)
A list of 10 question types to use when systematically challenging assumptions in first-principles thinking

How it works: 1. Confirming questions: 'Are we sure that's true?'
2. What-if questions: 'What if this were possible?'
3. Possibility questions: 'What would need to be true for this to be possible?'
4. Confidence questions: 'How confident are you in that conclusion?'
5. Evidence questions: 'What evidence do you have for that conclusion?'
6. Why questions: 'Why is that?' — can be repeated multiple times to dig deeper
7. Dumb questions: 'Can you explain this to me?'
8. Clarifying questions: 'Can you clarify what you mean by that?'
9. Example questions: 'Can you give me an example of that?'
10. Certainty questions: 'What do we know to be absolutely true?'

### Five Lessons About Product Usage (How to develop product sense)
Five enduring lessons about how real users interact with products, derived from hundreds of user observation sessions.

How it works: 1. People are time-crunched and distracted when they use your product. They might not read labels/text and might not spend even a few seconds figuring out what to do. Pick the right defaults and use visual design and cues to make primary actions obvious (prominence, lack of distractions).
2. People will drop out of a product flow as soon as they feel confused or nervous they might be doing something wrong. Make labels unambiguous and contrast options appropriately.
3. Don't give people too much information at once — once they feel overwhelmed, they tend to leave. Example: Slack's pricing page saw increased purchases when information was moved behind a dropdown list.
4. Context impacts decisions. Use tools like comparisons, contrasting, and social proof to make it easier for users to decide.
5. Make sure the goal of your product and possible actions are clear to users. Example: Slack increased user retention on mobile just by telling new users what Slack is and linking to a video showing how a team might use it.

### How to Determine if 'Feel' Matters for Your Product (What working at Figma taught me about customer obsession)
Questions and methods to assess whether investing in product feel is important for your specific product

How it works: 1. How frequently is the product used by your user? High-frequency (daily use) = feel is make-or-break. Examples: communication tools (email/messaging), productivity tools (IDEs, spreadsheets), design tools. 2. Are there existing behaviors and muscle memory from competitor tools? If yes, accommodate these expectations first, then find ways to surpass them. 3. Ask users directly: 'Do you like using our product? If not, why?' Listen for ineffable feedback like 'It just feels clunky.' Don't dismiss it — lean into it. 4. To convince stakeholders internally: Show customer quotes, show videos of users struggling or being delighted, leverage the visceral response people have when seeing real users interact with software.

### Optical Weight Figma Exercise (Jessica Hische)
A quick test to see how professional typefaces use optical illusions to appear perfect.

How it works: 1. Open a design tool like Figma. 2. Type a single lowercase letter (like 'a', 'n', or 'r') using a geometric sans-serif font. 3. Scale the letter up to fill the page. 4. Draw a perfect circle or vertical lines to measure the stroke width. 5. Compare the width of a straight vertical stroke to the width where two strokes join (the joint). Notice how the designer subtracted weight at the joint to prevent it from looking too dark or heavy.

### Product Critique Questions (Julie Zhuo) (How to develop product sense)
Five questions for deconstructing any product to build design intuition, adapted from Julie Zhuo's 'How to Do a Product Critique'.

How it works: 1. What's the experience of getting started or signing up?
2. How does this app explain itself in the first minute?
3. How easy to use was the app?
4. How did you feel while exploring the app?
5. Did the app deliver on your expectations?

### Product Sense Development Process (Julie Zhuo)
A step-by-step approach to building product intuition.

How it works: 1. Observe your own reactions and assumptions at every step of using a new app. 2. Discuss and critique products with others to understand different perspectives. 3. Read deep-dive teardowns from experts. 4. Validate assumptions quantitatively by studying A/B test results.

### Questions to Ask Great Product Thinkers (How to develop product sense)
Five questions to ask product leaders to understand their processes, decision-making, and principles.

How it works: 1. What prompted you to build your product?
   → Reveals the type of user insights you should look for and the process to get them.
2. What were the key decision points along the way?
3. What alternative approaches did you consider?
   → Understanding discarded solutions and why helps you learn how they test hypotheses and make trade-offs.
4. What were surprising insights or results?
   → Uncovering when initial hypotheses were wrong and why yields great insights.
5. What principles or frameworks helped you navigate the ambiguity?
   → Great product thinkers internalize product principles they use to evaluate solutions. If you uncover those principles, you can use them too.

### Shopify's Product Quality Benchmarking Questions (How Shopify builds product)
Questions to ask when evaluating whether your product meets a high quality bar

How it works: Questions to ask about any product/feature: - Is this good enough? Are we proud of this? - Is this iconic in the way that Apple products are iconic? - Is this iconic in the way that Porsche is iconic? - Is this iconic in the way that Rolex is iconic? - Would Steve Jobs have been willing to put his name on this? - Is this the version that's kind of, sort of okay, or is this truly great? - If this is the most widely distributed software product I ever work on, am I satisfied with it? - Can you see where the org chart breaks are by looking at the product? (You shouldn't be able to.)

### Signs Your Product Sense Is Improving (How to develop product sense)
Six indicators that your product sense is developing over time, useful as a self-assessment rubric.

How it works: You're getting better at product sense when you:
1. Notice subtle things about products and people that you would have missed before (e.g. micro frustrations and delights)
2. Anticipate non-obvious user problems when you look at product experiences or before you present at product reviews
3. Develop higher-quality hypotheses about product experiences to build, even in the face of ambiguity
4. Contribute more unique insights to your team, given your improved understanding of users and the landscape
5. Are right more often than not about what impact a change to a flow has on metrics
6. Potentially receive comments from your design partner on how impressed they are with a detail you noticed

### Sources for Tracking Macro Technology Trends (How to develop product sense)
Concrete recommendations for staying up to date on macro technology trends that create product opportunities.

How it works: 1. Watch annual developer conferences from major tech companies: Google I/O, Apple WWDC, Meta F8, Amazon re:Invent
2. Read commentary from industry analysts (e.g. Ben Thompson / Stratechery)
3. Follow tech founders and investors on Twitter (e.g. Naval Ravikant, Elad Gil, Balaji Srinivasan) — pay attention to trends they're bullish on
4. Invest in or advise startups in spaces that interest you; if not possible, follow what top VCs are investing in and track those companies
5. For micro trends: meet with engineers and domain experts and go deep on topics like new APIs or platform capabilities

### Taste Traps for Product Leaders (Shreyas Doshi Live)
A list of cognitive biases and social proof patterns that fool product leaders into thinking they have good judgment when they don't

How it works: Common traps that fool PMs: 1) Catchy metaphors (two-way door catches on, 'reversible/irreversible decisions' does not — same idea); 2) Alliterations (fail fast > fail quickly, fast follow — the alliteration makes the idea more attractive than its substance warrants); 3) Authority bias (idea is more compelling because Bezos said it); 4) Complicated charts and math we don't understand (some leaders weaponize this); 5) Social proof (everyone believes it so it must be right). Test: Evaluate the idea completely separate from its packaging, social proof, and authority source.

## Examples

### Apple Keynote Design Tenets (Bob Baxley)
Steve Jobs' three foundational rules for building the Keynote presentation software.

How it works: 1. It should be difficult to make ugly presentations. 2. Focus on cinematic quality transitions. 3. Optimize for innovation over PowerPoint compatibility.

### Instagram Stories vs Facebook Stories launch approaches (Sanchan Saxena)
How Kevin Systrom's intentional, non-A/B-tested launch of Stories on Instagram succeeded while Facebook's mathematically modeled approach for Stories struggled — illustrating the innovator's dilemma.

How it works: Instagram approach: Kevin Systrom went all-in on the new format without extensive A/B testing of trade-offs. Didn't measure whether adding Stories would reduce feed engagement and revenue. Cut first, then iterated from the new baseline. Stories were limited to real-time photos only (no uploading old photos) because the intentionality was 'world's largest real-time network.' Facebook approach: Mathematical modeling of trade-offs — successful feed business generating billions vs new format with zero advertisers and unknown engagement. This is the innovator's dilemma in action. Result: Stories thrived on Instagram, struggled on Facebook. Key insight: These were independent team experiments, NOT a top-down mandate from Zuck despite media rumors.

### James Dyson - Initiating Failure to Discover New Paths (First-principles thinking)
Dyson's approach of intentionally doing things wrong to find undiscovered solutions

How it works: Philosophy: 'If you want to discover something that other people haven't, you need to do things the wrong way. Initiate a failure by doing something that's very silly, unthinkable, naughty, dangerous. Watching why that fails can take you on a completely different path.'

Example: Spent 7 years on a washing machine with two drums instead of one.

Result: Dyson now generates over $7 billion/year in revenue from products built through this approach.

### Linear's Issue Drafts Feature (Nan Yu)
A practical application of the Extreme Extrapolation framework.

How it works: To solve saving drafts, Linear built a 'super fast/unsafe' version (no save prompts, just closes) and a 'super safe' version (auto-save everything immediately, creating untitled document clutter). The final solution combined both: it prompts to save on brand new issues, but auto-saves silently on existing drafts.

### OpenAI/GPT - Challenging 'Everybody Knew' Assumptions (First-principles thinking)
How the breakthrough leading to GPT came from experimenting with an idea that everyone in the field 'knew' couldn't work

How it works: Context: 'Everybody knew that you cannot train deep networks. Back propagation is too weak.' Researchers were focused on models where they could mathematically prove perfect training, which severely restricted model power.

Breakthrough: By dropping the requirement for elegant mathematical proofs and simply trying to train large neural networks with data, they discovered what 'every child knows' today—that large neural networks produce amazing results.

Lesson: When an entire field 'knows' something can't be done, it's worth questioning whether that knowledge is actually based on fundamental limits or just on conventions and biases accumulated over time.

### Products Born from Strong Product Sense (How to develop product sense)
Three examples of products that originated from strong product sense — combining empathy with creative solutions.

How it works: 1. iPhone — Built on insight that people value aesthetics, not just functionality. Designed around the idea that consumers needed a smartphone that felt personal.
2. Gmail — Addressed unmet user needs: low storage quotas, poor search experience, related messages separated instead of threaded.
3. Superhuman — Saw need for modern email client for busy professionals to get through email quickly. Used thoughtful design for fast workflows and limited distractions.

### Slack's Rooster Detail — Attention to User Experience (How to develop product sense)
Example of Stewart Butterfield's philosophy that every detail matters, illustrated by Slack's @channel notification warning feature.

How it works: When a user tries to use @channel to message a large number of teammates across multiple time zones, Slack shows a cartoon rooster asking them to think twice about notifying people.
- Not built to move metrics but to prevent anxiety for people receiving work notifications at odd hours
- Rooster icon chosen to keep tone playful so message sender doesn't feel ashamed or guilty
- Customer tickets at Slack frequently contained positive feedback thanking the team for this type of thoughtfulness
- People often couldn't say exactly WHY they loved Slack — it wasn't one big feature but attention to details across the product

Key lesson: 'If you remove from your product lots of small annoyances that people deal with on a daily basis, the value you get from doing that adds up to something meaningful.'

### Spotify Home Feed Redesign (Recall vs. Discovery) (Gustav Söderström)
A case study on the risks of changing a UI optimized for 'recall' (finding known items) to one optimized for 'discovery' (finding new items).

How it works: Spotify shifted its home feed from 90% recall to 90% discovery. Users rebelled because they couldn't find their existing playlists. Lesson: Discovery requires low-cost, fast-swiping UIs (feeds), while recall requires dense, multi-item UIs.

### Square Cash Card - Ayo Omojola's First-Principles Approach (First-principles thinking)
Example of first-principles thinking applied at Square by going to the source, visiting the factory, and asking questions until reaching the fundamental truth

How it works: Approach:
1. Notice something important that isn't good enough
2. Go to the source (e.g. the factory) and talk to people to understand why
3. Keep asking questions until you 'get to the end'

Key insight: People give answers they believe to be true—they're not lying or being malicious—but the answers are often 'wonk' (wrong/incomplete). You have to keep pushing until you get to the actual answer.

Application today: Ask lots of questions that people think don't matter. When optimizing something for the first time, look at it 15 different ways. Every time two things are incongruent, figure out why. It's tedious work.

### Stripe Checkout Quality ROI (Katie Dill)
An example of how design details directly impact business metrics.

How it works: Stripe researched top e-commerce sites and found 99% had checkout errors. By maniacally focusing on small design details to remove friction, Stripe's new checkout flow increased business revenue by 10.5%.

### Superhuman's font selection process (Adelle Sans) (Rahul Vohra)
Detailed case study of how Superhuman selected and customized their typeface by optimizing for beauty, sentiment neutrality, reading speed, and email address rendering

How it works: Process: 1) Laid out UI in 15 major font families. 2) Printed and let designs marinate on a desk. 3) Evaluated against four criteria: a) Gorgeous on its own, b) Conveys any message sentiment without overpowering (works for party invitations AND death notices), c) Optimizes reading speed and comprehension (narrow characters, ~90-120 character line length), d) Makes email addresses look natural (at symbol baseline alignment). 4) Selected Adelle Sans by Type Together. 5) Worked with a type designer to fix specific glyph issues. Done with ~10-15 users.

### ThoughtSpot Design Tenets (Bob Baxley)
Three actionable rules used to guide design decisions and resolve debates at an enterprise data company.

How it works: 1. Documentation is a failure state (users shouldn't have to read a manual). 2. Start simple and force users to opt into complexity. 3. The entire product should look and feel like it came from a single mind.

### Trend-Driven Product Opportunities (How to develop product sense)
Three examples of products that leveraged emerging technology or social trends to create new value.

How it works: 1. Cash App + Bitcoin: Decided to support Bitcoin transactions; 76% (~$4.6B) of 2020 revenue came from Bitcoin.
2. Uber: Became possible because of smartphone proliferation with GPS + availability of Google Maps APIs.
3. Clubhouse: Took off quickly because pandemic accelerated need for virtual public discourse.
4. Figma: High-quality browser-based design app became possible only once WebGL became performant enough.

### Twitter's 'Swish' (Sparkle) Icon (Kayvon Beykpour)
A case study in how optimizing for metrics can lead to customer-hostile product decisions.

How it works: Twitter allowed users to toggle to a reverse-chronological feed, but forced them back to the ranked feed after 24 hours because the ranked feed drove higher DAU, despite users explicitly asking to stay on reverse-chron.

### UX Frustration and Delight Moments (How to develop product sense)
Real examples of product frustration and delight to illustrate what to look for when observing your own product usage.

How it works: Frustration examples:
- Medical app: Can't remember password, password reset never sends email after multiple attempts → stopped using the service entirely
- Car rental: Input start time and immediately get error about end time being before start time (was going to update it anyway) → feels stupid and frustrated

Delight examples:
- Carta's stock-vesting email: Includes confetti animation that elevates the feeling of celebration
- Google Photos collages: Combines multiple photos of important people in delightful ways

### Uber Reserve — From Insight to $5B Business (Peter Deng)
How Peter's team at Uber identified the peace-of-mind problem for early morning airport rides and built Uber Reserve, now approaching $5B/year in revenue.

How it works: Problem: 6AM flight means waking at 4AM, hoping Ubers are available, poor sleep. Insight: Users want peace of mind and are willing to pay for it. Product decisions driven by the principle: tell users if timing is cutting it close ('you may not make your flight'), consider driver incentives (no-cancel guarantees). Outcome: One of Uber's highest-margin products, approaching $5B/year. Key lesson: Focus on what actually matters to users (emotional job of peace of mind), not pixel-level digital craft.
