# Continuous Product Discovery - Frameworks, Templates & Checklists

*37 artifacts extracted from Lenny's Podcast and Newsletter*

## Frameworks

### 80/20 Outside-the-Building Rule (Shaun Clowes)
Spend 80% of your time thinking about things going on outside the building (customers, market, competitors) and only 20% on internal matters. Referenced from Steve Blank's work.

How it works: In every document, in everything, always start from and talk from: 1) The customer's perspective, 2) The market's perspective, 3) The competitor's perspective. Support statements with anecdotes and bits of data. This reframes you from internal politics/scrum executor to someone everyone wants to help win.

### Build With Writers / Build With Readers (Sachin Monga)
A product development approach where features are co-developed with users through structured pilots before broad rollout

How it works: Steps: (1) Mock up the concept, (2) Call up ~10 writers/users who might be interested and get feedback, (3) Run a small pilot with real users (not just research — actual feature usage), (4) Iterate based on pilot results, (5) Use a standing 'Product Lab' (invite-only group of ~100 power users) for ongoing bleeding-edge testing, (6) Never roll out a fundamental change to everyone without going through this process. Key insight: what ships on day one is often quite different from the pre-pilot concept.

### Continuous Discovery vs. Project-Based Research (Teresa Torres)
A reframing of how discovery fits into product work: not as a phase before delivery, but as a parallel continuous habit that runs alongside delivery

How it works: Key principles: 1) Discovery and delivery are always happening simultaneously—never stop delivering to discover first. 2) Everything in the backlog is a bet; discovery makes bets better over time. 3) Minimum viable cadence: one interview per week + continuous assumption testing. 4) Assumption testing IS the start of delivery (not separate from it). 5) If you've been doing zero discovery, start doing some in parallel with your existing delivery—don't try to block delivery until discovery is 'done.' 6) Two core discovery activities: qualitative interviewing (learning about the opportunity space) and assumption testing (evaluating solutions). Reframe for skeptics: 'We don't have time for discovery' really means 'We don't have time for project-based research'—and that's correct. Continuous discovery is different.

### Discovery Risk Assessment (Teresa Torres)
A mental model for calibrating how much discovery effort to invest based on the risk level of a product bet and its strategic importance

How it works: Decision criteria: 1) Is this core to the product experience or a differentiator? → Do robust discovery with multiple solutions. 2) Is this a low-risk, well-understood pattern (e.g., forgot password flow)? → Less discovery needed, make the bet. 3) Are you new to discovery? → Overindex on doing more discovery to hone your risk judgment. 4) Are you instrumenting your product and measuring impact of releases? → If not, you may be underestimating risk. Key principle: Everything in the backlog is a bet whether you do discovery or not. Discovery makes it a better bet. When feeling stuck on an obvious solution for a high-stakes problem, increase the number of options you're considering.

### Double Diamond Process (Paige Costello)
A product discovery and definition framework alternating between divergent (broad) and convergent (narrow) thinking.

How it works: 1. Go broad: What customer should we solve for? 2. Go narrow: Pick one. 3. Go broad: What problems do they have? 4. Go narrow: Pick one problem. 5. Go broad: What solutions exist? 6. Go narrow: Pick the starting solution. Map internal artifacts (kickoff, design crit, spec) to these specific inflection points.

### Dual Track Agile (Camille Hearst)
A product management framework where discovery and delivery happen simultaneously to de-risk assumptions quickly.

How it works: Run discovery and delivery in parallel rather than waterfall. Prioritize the biggest swings (highest risk/reward) in the discovery track first to de-risk them before moving them to the delivery track.

### Exposure Hours (Guillermo Rauch)
An internal operating principle at Vercel for developing product taste and empathy.

How it works: Quantify and increase the amount of time you spend watching real people use your products. Guillermo enforces this by color-coding his calendar to ensure a minimum number of customer observation meetings.

### Five Whys for Product Opportunities (Yuhki Yamashata)
Extending the engineering postmortem technique of five whys to product management to find root causes of customer problems and unlock bigger product opportunities

How it works: Engineering version: Used in postmortems/retros to find root cause of outages. PM version: 1) Customer asks for a feature → 2) Why are they asking? (identify the problem) → 3) Why do they have that problem? (identify the underlying condition). Fixing the underlying condition = bigger product impact than the original feature request.

### Forward Deployed Engineering (FDE) Model (The unconventional Palantir principles that catalyzed a generation of startups)
A customer discovery and product development approach where engineers physically embed inside customer environments for extended periods (months, not hours), doing the customer's actual work with the product to discover real needs and build solutions in real-time.

How it works: Three-part approach:
1. Go fully inside the customer's environment — physically embed in their operations (e.g., operations centers, field locations), not just phone calls or office visits.
2. Don't just empathize with the user; BE the user — literally do their same job with your product as an extended member of their team.
3. Do real customer work long enough to have full empathy and inspire — stay embedded long enough that the customer is impressed you've accomplished something real for their business that they couldn't.

Key implementation details:
- In early engagements, the customer may have ZERO users of your product for the first 6-12 months while your team operates it
- Form a small team with direct access to integrate customer data, build prototype solutions, perform analysis, and brief results directly to leadership
- This is not a permanent state but a vanguard tool for approaching new use cases
- When innovating in emerging tech, customers don't yet conceptualize their future workflows, so by being one of them, you establish the first patterns for doing the work excellently

Practiced by: Palantir, Anduril

### Go and See (Jeremy Henrickson)
A leadership principle requiring decision-makers to observe the ground truth directly.

How it works: Leaders must walk all the way to the ground level (e.g., talking to the engineer writing the code, or reading the actual tax laws of a local municipality) rather than relying on top-level communication or delegating to specialists.

### IDEO Design Thinking (Five Stages) (Peter Deng)
The classic IDEO framework Peter learned at Stanford's d.school, which he emphasizes for the power of the first two words: empathize and define.

How it works: Five stages: 1. Empathize — feel the pain of your customers (not just theoretically understand). Dog food, do user research, be in the room. 2. Define — articulate the problem precisely. Be intentional about the words. 3. Ideate — brainstorm solutions. 4. Prototype — build something tangible. 5. Test — validate with users. Peter's key insight: the first two stages are where the real work happens and the words 'empathize' and 'define' are deliberately chosen to be powerful.

### Identifying Platform Commerce Opportunities (The inside story of Facebook Marketplace)
How to spot organic commerce behavior on a social platform that could be productized

How it works: Signal 1 - International research: In many emerging markets, more than half of people studied cited Facebook as a place they had bought or sold things, even though no commerce product existed. Western market blind spot meant employees didn't see this. Signal 2 - Community behavior: Mom groups, local groups, and interest groups organically developed buy/sell norms with no product support. Signal 3 - Unique user perspective: Deb was the only PM who was a mom, giving her access to mom groups where organic commerce was thriving. Signal 4 - Rotational/new employee perspective: Bowen Pan joined from TradeMe and immediately saw the opportunity. Fresh eyes from outside the company or from related industries can identify what insiders miss. Key lesson: Commerce opportunities may be invisible to the demographic makeup of your product team. Diverse perspectives (parents, international employees, new hires from adjacent industries) can reveal blind spots.

### Macro, Middle Range, and Micro Research (Judd Antin)
A framework for categorizing user research questions by altitude and business impact.

How it works: 1. Macro: Big picture, strategic, forward-looking innovation, competitive landscape, TAM studies. 2. Micro: Technical usability, pixel-perfect execution, AB test result deep-dives. 3. Middle Range: 'Blobular' questions about user feelings/behaviors that are interesting but often lack direct business impact (e.g., 'How do hosts feel about payment options?'). Judd argues teams do too much Middle Range and not enough Macro/Micro.

### Misdirected Briefing Technique (David Placek)
A brainstorming method where teams are given slightly altered or completely different contexts to free up creativity.

How it works: Use 3 small teams of 2 people. Team 1 gets the real brief. Team 2 gets a disguised brief (e.g., naming for Apple instead of Microsoft). Team 3 gets a completely different category (e.g., naming a bicycle instead of software). The best names usually come from Teams 2 and 3 because they are free to make mistakes.

### Opportunity Solution Tree (Teresa Torres)
A tree-structured visual that starts with an outcome at the root, branches into the opportunity space (unmet needs, pain points, desires), then branches into solutions and assumption tests. Used to add structure to the messy problem of going from an outcome to deciding what to build.

How it works: Structure: 1) Outcome (root) - the business/product outcome you're driving toward. 2) Opportunity Space (first branch) - structured using an experience map of the customer journey, with sub-branches for specific unmet needs, pain points, and desires at each step. Opportunities get smaller/more specific as you move down. 3) Solutions (second branch) - multiple solutions per opportunity for compare-and-contrast. 4) Assumption Tests (optional third branch) - tests for the riskiest assumptions underlying each solution. Key rules: opportunities should NEVER be solutions; they should be specific enough to be solvable; structure top-level opportunities around steps in the customer experience map.

### Opportunity Solution Tree Framework (The Best of Lenny’s Newsletter 2023)
Teresa Torres's framework for continuous product discovery, connecting outcomes to opportunities to solutions to experiments.

How it works: Teresa Torres's framework for continuous product discovery covered in a podcast episode. The Opportunity Solution Tree maps: desired outcomes → opportunities (customer needs/pain points) → solutions (product ideas) → experiments (tests to validate). Helps teams systematically connect customer research to product decisions.

### Power User Testing Program (Gammaster) (Grant Lee)
A dedicated Slack workspace for repeat/power users to test early wireframes and functional prototypes.

How it works: Isolate power users in a separate channel, share early concepts, and watch them struggle to identify UX issues before full development.

### Product Trio Model (Teresa Torres)
A collaborative working model where the product manager, designer, and software engineer make discovery and product decisions together as equals, rather than the PM being 'the decider'

How it works: Core principles: 1) The trio (PM, designer, engineer) decides together—no single decision-maker. 2) When you disagree, you haven't found the best option yet—keep looking. 3) Shared understanding from doing discovery together dramatically reduces disagreements. 4) Reject the 'PM as CEO of product' mentality as toxic business culture. 5) Force yourself to work in teams to build this muscle. Prerequisites for success: The trio does discovery together (interviews, assumption testing) to build shared understanding. Without shared context, disagreements are constant and unresolvable.

### Reality Check Usability Study (Bob Baxley)
A method for testing user behavior by having them use competitor or adjacent products instead of your own.

How it works: Bring users into a lab and watch them navigate a competitor's flow (e.g., checkout on eBay or Amazon). This removes the creator's bias and reveals unexpected user priorities (like shipping quotes being as important as price).

### The Four Forces of Progress (Bob Moesta)
A mental model to evaluate if a user will switch to a new product by weighing the forces pushing and pulling them against the friction holding them back.

How it works: F1 (Push of the current situation) + F2 (Pull of the new solution) must be greater than F3 (Anxiety of the new) + F4 (Habit of the present).

### Understand, Identify, Execute (Bangaly Kaba)
A product development methodology that mandates dedicated time for discovery before execution.

How it works: Replaces the anti-pattern 'Identify, Justify, Execute'. Requires adding explicit 'understand' tasks (e.g., data logging, user research, partnership strategy) to the sprint board alongside execution tasks.

### User-Centered Performance (Judd Antin)
A mental model for identifying when product teams are doing research for optics rather than actual learning.

How it works: Signs of performative research: Asking to 'validate assumptions' at the end of a product cycle, doing executive listening sessions just to feel close to the customer, and seeking confirmation rather than trying to falsify hypotheses.

## Templates

### OPA (Opportunity/Problem Assessment) Meeting (Annie Pearl)
A peer-to-peer meeting format for PMs to debate, discuss, and spar around problem spaces before moving to solutioning.

How it works: Attendees: PMs only (no executives/CPOs to ensure psychological safety). Purpose: Review research data and decide whether to move forward with developing a solution.

### Product Scrapbook (Notion Database) (Product manager is an unfair role. So work unfairly.)
A lightweight Notion database for collecting customer insights, feedback, and evidence organized by strategic swim lanes for faster discovery and planning.

How it works: Database structure:
- Each entry is a 'scrap' (feedback screenshot, chart, support ticket, link to Gong call, Slack thread, etc.)
- Each scrap gets a clear, searchable title
- Organized by swim lane property: e.g., Monetization, Onboarding, Internal Tooling, Virality, Technical Debt, etc.
- Keep notes lightweight—don't invest a lot of time in organizing because you don't know if an idea will ever get prioritized
- Collect clues from all sources: customer calls, support tickets, Slack, analytics, stakeholder conversations

Use cases:
1. When someone suggests a solution, share real-world context on the spot from your scrapbook
2. When an idea becomes a prioritized initiative, you already have the juiciest bits for a kickoff presentation
3. For quarterly planning: filter by swim lane to quickly get into mental context from raw customer signals
4. For onboarding new PMs to opportunities

## Checklists

### Customer Conversation Calendar Audit (Dalton Caldwell)
A heuristic to measure if a founder is actually talking to customers enough.

How it works: Review your calendar for the past month. 20% to 30% of your total time should be explicitly blocked off for 'customer meeting' or 'customer call' with specific individuals. Buying ads or looking at analytics does not count.

### Customer Interaction Systems (14 habits of highly effective product managers)
Three structured approaches to ensure regular customer contact

How it works: Three systems to choose from or combine: (1) Weekly 'Lunch with a customer' — informal meal or call with a real user; (2) Monthly CX rotation — PM and team members spend time doing customer support; (3) Quarterly customer visit — in-person or dedicated deep-dive sessions with key customers. Additionally, build 1-on-1 relationships with larger customers for quick, raw feedback and pain point discovery.

### Customer Support as Everyone's Job — Implementation Rhythm (What working at Figma taught me about customer obsession)
The three-step rhythm Figma used when handling any customer interaction, from support tickets to sales calls to random encounters

How it works: Three-step rhythm for every customer interaction: (1) Understand the customer's problem, (2) Unblock the customer by giving them immediate support, (3) If needed, change the product so that other customers don't run into the same problem. Apply this rhythm to: bug fixing, finding gaps in the product, support tickets, sales calls, research trips, and even random encounters with users (e.g., at airports). Key behaviors: Engineers and designers respond directly to customers in support channels. Team members visit customers in person when issues can't be reproduced remotely. Weekend responsiveness when users are working on important projects. Treat customer problems as your own problems.

### Go to the Source Checklist (First-principles thinking)
Five methods for getting to primary information rather than relying on secondhand assumptions

How it works: 1. Visit the factory — physically go where the work is done
2. Read the primary research — don't rely on summaries or hearsay
3. Talk to the people making the raw ingredients (or APIs) — go upstream to the actual makers
4. Push back on gatekeepers — don't accept 'that's how it's done' as an answer
5. Question 'authority' — remember that we have a bias to trust authority (authority bias)

### The Five Tools of a Great Researcher (Judd Antin)
A checklist of the five core competencies a modern, multi-method user researcher should possess.

How it works: 1. Formative/Generative UX Research (open-ended, ethnographic, innovation-focused). 2. Evaluative Research (usability testing). 3. Rigorous Survey Design (scaled responses). 4. Applied Statistics (to interact in an AB testing world). 5. SQL/Dashboarding/Prompt Engineering (technical skills to query data and use generative AI).

### Whole-Team User Research Practices (How to ship like a startup)
Practices for making user research everyone's responsibility, not just researchers'

How it works: 1. Require research attendance: Set expectation that each person on the team attends at least 50% of research sessions.
2. Invite questions: Encourage team members to chime in on live user calls and follow promising lines of questioning. Pro tip: Avoid leading questions.
3. ABR (Always Be Researching): User interviews aren't the only way to gather insights. Reach out directly to users on X and community forums. Once public, ask a friend, ask your mom, ask a random person in a coffee shop. The best feedback often comes when you least expect it.
4. Prototype for proof: Use throwaway code as a superpower. Quick, scrappy prototypes validate ideas, clarify tradeoffs, and get stronger user reactions. A two-week experiment that saves four months of misguided development is always worth it.

## Examples

### Airbnb Customer Journey Storyboarding (Nancy Duarte)
Using Pixar-style storyboarding to map out the customer's real-life journey to identify strategic gaps.

How it works: Airbnb hired a Pixar illustrator to draw key frames of a host/guest's day (e.g., alarm goes off, brushing teeth, booking). They placed 12 frames in the office and picked 6 to improve, shifting their entire strategy to mobile-first.

### Netflix Opportunity Solution Tree Example (Teresa Torres)
A worked example of structuring the opportunity space for a streaming entertainment service like Netflix, using the experience map of entertaining yourself with streaming content

How it works: Outcome: Increase engagement with Netflix. Experience Map Steps: 1) Trigger - deciding to watch something. 2) Deciding what to watch (and what platform). 3) Evaluating whether content is good. 4) The viewing experience itself. 5) Post-viewing experience (encouraging continued watching). Example opportunities under 'deciding what to watch': 'I have a movie title in mind but don't know how to find it' (pain point), 'I was watching a show and can't get back to it' (pain point), 'I can't tell if this show is good or not' (big opportunity). Decomposition example: 'I can't decide what to watch' → 'I don't know if this show is any good' → 'Who's the cast?' (evaluating shows). Key insight: whether you work at Netflix or Hulu, the opportunity spaces look similar; differentiation comes from which opportunities you pursue and how you solve them.

### Paul Graham's Airbnb 'Go to Your Customers' Story (Summary: Lessons from working with 600+ YC startups | Gustaf Alströmer (Y Combinator, Airbnb))
Canonical example of prioritizing customer proximity over everything else

How it works: One of the most important moments in Airbnb history: Paul Graham asked the founders 'Where are your customers?' They said 'Oh, they're in New York.' Graham responded: 'So why are you talking to me and not in New York right now talking to them?'

Lesson: No amount of advisor conversations, investor meetings, or remote product work substitutes for being physically present with your customers. Go where they are.

### The Multimillion Dollar Button (Judd Antin)
A case study demonstrating the massive business value of fast, micro-level evaluative research.

How it works: At Airbnb, micro-research revealed users were abandoning the purchase funnel because the Call to Action (CTA) text on a button made them afraid it would immediately initiate a purchase. By changing just seven characters on the button, conversion increased by 1%, making the company millions of dollars. The research took roughly 48 hours.

## Tools

### 24/7 Live Chat for User Research (Nikita Bier)
Embedding live customer support chat directly into a V1 consumer app to gather immediate qualitative feedback.

How it works: Provides a white-glove experience that eliminates confounding variables about user confusion, and acts as a direct pipeline for feature ideas and bug reports pasted directly into Slack.

### Influencer Social Graph Scraper (Claire Butler)
A custom script to identify key influencers and sub-communities within a target audience on Twitter.

How it works: Inputs a few known influencers, scrapes who follows them and who they follow, and clusters them by specific niches (e.g., iconographers, PMs) to target for early product feedback via direct messages.

### Live Usability Slack Thread (Noah Weiss)
A method for generating instant user research reports and building team empathy by live-blogging usability sessions.

How it works: Engineers, designers, and PMs dial into a usability test. Everyone posts real-time reactions, ideas, and observations in a single Slack thread. The thread becomes the de facto research report and source of truth.
